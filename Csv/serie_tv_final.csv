0,Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan,United States,Netflix,Netflix,Masayoshi Haneda Masami Kosaka Hideaki Itō Hayate Masao,,44,"Documentary,History,War",1,6,"Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan is an American documentary streaming television series distributed by Netflix and released on February 24, 2021. It takes place in feudal Japan from 1551 to 1616, during the final phase of the Sengoku period (The Age of Warring States), mainly the Azuchi–Momoyama period. It features reenactments of historical events and commentary by voice-over artist Hiro Kanagawa and historians Stephen Turnbull, David Spafford, Tomoko Kitagawa, Isaac Meyer and others. The story is about several powerful daimyo (warlords) who clash to unify Japan.",,,"The ostensible subjects of “Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan” are dubbed “the mounted knights of old Japan” and while a properly romantic description, it falls a bit short: The sword-wielding martial artists of the feudal era (1185-1868) have not only taken up residence in the Western imagination but created ornate, interlacing connections between pop cultures East and West. Akira Kurosawa, for instance, who was a student of John Ford, portrayed his heroes like the gunslingers of the Old West, or even Prohibition gangsters. Detective novelist Dashiell Hammett’s 1929 “Red Harvest” was the basis for Kurosawa’s “Yojimbo,” which in turn inspired Sergio Leone’s “A Fistful of Dollars,” which inspired the Bruce Willis movie “Last Man Standing.” Beneath all the intersecting fictional mayhem lay feudal roots. Most of us samurai-movie fans just don’t know where or what they are.The experts in “Age of Samurai” certainly do. And they tell far more than the average viewer is going to be able to consume over the six parts of the documentary series, which is devoted to the history, traditions and politics not just of the samurai but of Japan itself. It is as much about the “Age” as of the “Samurai” and follows a path familiar to Netflix documentary viewers: Historians and other academics and authors comment on the story being retold, while dramatic re-creations follow it—often, in this case, to harrowing effect. According to one of the interviewees, samurai, a word that originally meant “servant,” were “probably the greatest warriors the world has ever known.” This is precisely the kind of unprovable hype that might turn a viewer off, though the dramatic portions of the program strive to make it seem so: The descriptions, accounts and dramatic re-enactments of the “melee combat” conducted with the legendary katana (samurai swords) result in geysers of blood, rolling heads and certainly are meant to impress viewers with not just the degree but the intimacy of the violence that occurred between rival clans, which used the samurai as their infantry.It’s a fascinating narrative retold and begins here in 1551 with the death of Oda Nobuhide, head of the powerful Oda clan at a time when the central government of Japan had collapsed and incited civil wars across the country among the various power- and land-hungry daimyo, or warlords. The principal character, beginning with episode 1, is Oda Nobunaga, the unpredictable, bloodthirsty and ultimately brilliant son of Nobuhide who would become the first “great unifier” of Japan, but not before modernizing military strategies and introducing firearms into what was previously an arena of hand-to-hand combat.“Age of Samurai” has an international cast of academicians, some quite captivating, on hand to deliver a historically substantiated account of the samurai and their emerging nation. They include the historian-authors Stephen Turnbull, David Spafford, Tomoko Kitagawa and others, all of whom seem to agree on almost everything that happened, which seems odd: Aren’t historians supposed to disagree? One might expect more clashing of academic katanas, but they are as unified as Japan would be, more or less, when the feudal bloodletting was over.",7.5,2218,Positive,0.705
1,Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,United States,ABC Studios Marvel Television Mutant Enemy Productions,Walt Disney Television,Clark Gregg Ming-Na Wen Brett Dalton Chloe Bennet Iain De Caestecker Elizabeth Henstridge Nick Blood Adrianne Palicki Henry Simmons Luke Mitchell John Hannah Natalia Cordova-Buckley Jeff Ward,Joss Whedon Jed Whedon Maurissa Tancharoen,42,"Action Drama,Science fiction,Superhero",7,136,"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is an American television series created by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Maurissa Tancharoen for ABC, based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division), a peacekeeping and spy agency in a world of superheroes. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of the franchise's films and other television series. The series was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions, with Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell serving as showrunners.
The series stars Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, reprising his role from the film series, alongside Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge. Nick Blood, Adrianne Palicki, Henry Simmons, Luke Mitchell, John Hannah, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward joined in later seasons. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents deal with various unusual cases and enemies, including Hydra, Inhumans, Life Model Decoys, alien species such as the Kree and Chronicoms, and time travel. Several episodes directly crossover with MCU films or other television series, notably Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) which significantly affected the series in its first season. In addition to Gregg, other actors from throughout the MCU also appear in guest roles.
The Avengers writer and director Joss Whedon began developing a S.H.I.E.L.D. pilot following the film's release in August 2012, and Gregg was confirmed to reprise his role that October. The series was officially picked up by ABC in May 2013. The series attempted to replicate the production value of the MCU films on a broadcast television budget, while also having to work within the constraints of the MCU which were dictated by Marvel Studios and the films. Prosthetic makeup was created by Glenn Hetrick's Optic Nerve Studios, while Legacy Effects contributed other practical effects. Composer Bear McCreary recorded each episode's score with a full orchestra, while the visual effects for the series were created by several different vendors and have been nominated for multiple awards.
The series premiered on ABC in the United States on September 24, 2013, and concluded with a two-part series finale on August 12, 2020, with 136 episodes broadcast over seven seasons. After starting the first season with high ratings but mixed reviews, the ratings began to drop while reviews improved. Ratings continued to lower with subsequent seasons, but were more consistent within each season, while reviews for later seasons were consistently positive. Several characters created for the series have since been introduced to the comic universe and other media. An online digital series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot, centered on Cordova-Buckley's Elena ""Yo-Yo"" Rodriguez, was released in December 2016 on ABC.com. Other spin-offs were planned but never materialized.","Section: Cast and characters (1):
Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson and Sarge / Pachakutiq:Coulson is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and later becomes the organization's director. In April 2013, Gregg agreed to join the series after hearing creator Joss Whedon's explanation for Coulson's resurrection, following the character's death in The Avengers, which he called ""fascinating"" and ""true to the world of the comics"". Gregg approached Coulson's promotion to director as getting his dream job, which at the same time forced the character to adopt a more level-headed attitude, like that of Nick Fury. After being possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in the fourth season finale, the Kree blood that resurrected Coulson is burned away and he ultimately dies following the fifth-season finale. Gregg plays a new character, Sarge, in season six, and portrays a Chronicom-enhanced Life Model Decoy version of Coulson in season seven.
Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May:Joss Whedon had the character, a S.H.I.E.L.D. ace pilot and weapons expert, nicknamed ""the Cavalry"", and originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets, ""rolling around in his head"" for a long time. Wen was given some backstory for the character to prepare, but was not told how she gained her reputation; with May's past revealed in ""Melinda"", Wen called it ""devastating ... To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many ... I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat."" Wen called May ""unconventionally maternal"", and said that it is her relationship with Coulson that makes her stay at S.H.I.E.L.D., despite her past.
Brett Dalton as Grant Ward and Hive:Ward is a Hydra agent who poses as a S.H.I.E.L.D. black ops specialist. From the conception of the series it was decided that he would be a traitor. Jed Whedon explained that they wanted to have ""infiltration based on betrayal"" on a small scale to represent the same thing happening on a massive scale, and to make the Hydra revelation more personal for the characters. Dalton felt that Ward was always more loyal to his Hydra superior John Garrett than to Hydra itself, and that he would become more of a wildcard after Garrett's death, though still an antagonist to S.H.I.E.L.D. Ward is killed by Coulson in season three, and his body is possessed by an ancient Inhuman, Hive. Dalton returned to the series in its fourth season to portray Ward in the virtual reality Framework, where he is Johnson's boyfriend. Austin Lyon portrays a young Ward.
Chloe Bennet as Skye / Daisy Johnson / Quake:An Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent with the ability to manipulate vibrations and create earthquakes. The character of Skye was always intended to become the MCU version of Johnson, having consequences for the character's relationships with the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, especially Coulson. Bennet felt that the character was someone who would wear her heart on her sleeve while having some control over her emotions. Wen noted that the character evolves from being ""anti-establishment into suddenly being someone who wants to create an establishment that would help"" the Inhumans. In the third season she no longer goes by ""Skye"" and gains the public name ""Quake"".
Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz:An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who specializes in engineering, especially weapons technology. De Caestecker described the character as ""quite passionate about what he does"" but not emotionally intelligent. Fitz has a close relationship with Simmons; De Caestecker says they ""just kind of fit each other in a very weird way."" The character suffers brain injuries at the end of the first season. The writers researched brain trauma with doctors and experts before approaching it in the series. De Caestecker did his own research as well, feeling it is ""something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing ... we just have to constantly be respectful towards it.""
Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons:A S.H.I.E.L.D. biochemist who specializes in life sciences (both human and alien). Henstridge described her character as ""intelligent and focused and curious...she's got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other."" As Fitz and Simmons begin to spend time apart during the series, Henstridge noted that it ""brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters"" since they have been nearly inseparable since first meeting. On the harsher side of Simmons seen in later seasons, Henstridge noted that the character has ""always been very mathematical in a way"". Simmons is ""profoundly"" changed after being trapped on the planet Maveth for six months.
Nick Blood as Lance Hunter:A mercenary before agreeing to join S.H.I.E.L.D. Blood described Hunter as someone who ""doesn't bow down to the etiquette of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy."" He later elaborated that the character feels very independent, so would probably not want to admit no longer feeling like an outsider. Also, ""he doesn't have too much respect for authority and titles...If Coulson does something he respects, that's all good. If he doesn't, he's going to say something."" On Hunter's on-again, off-again relationship with Bobbi Morse, Blood said, ""there is a lot of truth in it of those relationships you have where it's kind of, 'can't live with each other, can't kill each other'"".
Adrianne Palicki as Bobbi Morse:Hunter's ex-wife and an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who spent time undercover within Hydra. Palicki was approached by the showrunners specifically for the part during season two. Palicki already had martial arts and gun training, but had to learn to use the character's signature arnis sticks; she noted similarities between Morse's fighting style and that of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow from the MCU films. Showrunner Jeffrey Bell said the character is more loyal to an idea than anything else, so what may seem in the short term as a betrayal by her is usually for what she sees as the greater good.
Henry Simmons as Alphonso ""Mack"" MacKenzie:A S.H.I.E.L.D. mechanic with a distrust of the alien and superhuman. Simmons said the character is more worried about contributing in his own way and getting his job done away from the field. Mack does not like violence, but does ""what he has to do."" Mack reveals in the third season that he relies on his ""faith"", implying that he is a Christian. Dee Hogan of The Mary Sue described this as ""a refreshingly positive portrayal of people of faith, as Mack demonstrates the quiet confidence and love rather than the aggression and bigotry that's so often associated with it."" Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in season six.
Luke Mitchell as Lincoln Campbell:An Inhuman with the ability to manipulate electrical charges. The character was introduced because the series already featured ""a guy with no eyes"" and ""a woman who now is covered in thorns"" but, like the X-Men, there are also Inhumans who are ""just attractive people with powers"", and so Campbell represents them in the series. Campbell dies in the third-season finale, making him the ""Fallen Agent"" that the series had been teasing for the entire second half of that season. The decision was made because the producers did not want ""a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes.""
John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe:A transhumanist who believes in the improvement of humanity through enhancement. Radcliffe initially worked with Hive before joining S.H.I.E.L.D., where he begins work on transferring his artificial intelligence AIDA to a Life Model Decoy, an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project.
Natalia Cordova-Buckley as Elena ""Yo-Yo"" Rodriguez:A Colombian Inhuman who can move at super speed for a beat of her heart, before returning to the point she started from. She reluctantly joins S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes a part of the Secret Warriors, eventually growing close to Mack, who gives her the nickname ""Yo-Yo"". When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character.
Jeff Ward as Deke Shaw: A ""roguish scavenger"" on the Lighthouse space station in the year 2091, who returns to the present with the S.H.I.E.L.D. team and learns he is the grandson of Fitz and Simmons.

After The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment in 2009, they announced that a Marvel Television division was being formed under Jeph Loeb. In the following months, various pilots based on comics from Marvel's catalog went into development. In July 2012, Marvel Television entered into discussions with ABC to make a new series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The series was described as ""'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show."" On August 7, 2012, Joss Whedon was announced to be involved in the series' development. Whedon had written and directed the successful MCU film The Avengers (2012) On August 8, Whedon, along with his brother Jed and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen, met with Loeb to pitch him their idea for the series, with meetings in the following days with ABC Studios and ABC network. At the end of August, ABC ordered a pilot for a series called S.H.I.E.L.D., to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Jed Whedon and Tancharoen also writing. Disney CEO Bob Iger greenlit the series after watching the Marvel One-Shot short film Item 47.In April 2013, ABC announced that the series would be titled Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and it was officially picked up for a full season of 22 episodes in May 2013. Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell served as the series' showrunners, with Bell joining the show to help the inexperienced former pair with hiring crew members and ""navigating the politics of studios and networks"", saying, ""My job is to help them learn how to do that, to steer the ship while they learn."" Joss Whedon assisted them before he started work on the sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). The series was renewed for a second season in May 2014, a third in May 2015, and a fourth in March 2016.In September 2016, discussing the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, ""You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, we will continue to move forward."" Jed Whedon added, ""There are always ideas in the back of your mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet."" A fifth season was ordered in May 2017, and Bell said they had ""a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly."" Jed Whedon continued, ""Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying"". The writers intended for the final episode of the fifth season to serve as both a season and series finale, with some elements that could be adjusted based on whether the series was renewed for a sixth season or not. Whedon added, ""we're ready for if this is the end. We're definitely going to make it rewarding either way."" Despite this, the series was renewed for a sixth season in May 2018, and a final seventh season in November 2018. Whedon likened these two seasons to bonus levels in a video game, allowing the writers to have ""a bit of freedom"".

Section: Writing (2):
Bell explained that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise all of the series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, a member of the series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.In January 2013, Joss Whedon deflected any direct influences from other series, such as the efforts of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in The X-Files, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on ""the peripheral people...the people on the edges of the grand adventures."" As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences ""seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that."" Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, ""The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that.""On the balance between creating new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics in a way that works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, ""We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it."" About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create ""Marvel moments"" as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so ""If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we want to be in the car with the character having that experience.""

Actress Ming-Na Wen attributed the time slot shift between the first and second seasons (from 8 pm EST to 9 pm EST) for allowing the writers ""a chance to be more serious with certain topics, a little bit more intense with the fight scenes"" in the second season, since the first season had to be more reserved because of it airing during a family time slot. In September 2015, Bell looked back on the first two seasons and talked about the challenges of and changes in the series. He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that ""whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [hope to] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters."" A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of ""finding new combinations and new conflicts"" between different sets of characters, given ""a lot of procedurals [see] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all.""The producers and writers initially formed a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet likened the end of the third season to ""the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show."" She elaborated that ""the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show"" moving forward. The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to ""skew a little darker because of"" this change, with Loeb adding that ""It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [though]. I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making Deadpool anytime soon on [ABC]."" Marvel ""had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak"" in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of Ghost Rider in the season over one of Marvel's Netflix television series, because Marvel felt ""that this character was right to tell [darker and more violent] stories right now"" and having him on S.H.I.E.L.D. aided that because ""it was so unexpected"". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.

Section: Casting (2):
Sarah Halley Finn, the casting director of the MCU films, along with her associate Tamara Hunter, served as casting directors during the first season. In October 2012, a casting sheet for five lead roles was sent out, with Finn establishing offices in London, Australia, New York, Vancouver, Toronto, and Los Angeles to audition actors. At the New York Comic Con, Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige, and Clark Gregg announced that Gregg would be reprising his role as agent Phil Coulson from Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Avengers, and the Marvel One-Shots in the pilot, and would ""headline"" the series. Also in October, actress Ming-Na Wen was cast as Melinda May. The next month, Elizabeth Henstridge and Iain De Caestecker were cast as Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, respectively, while newcomer Brett Dalton was cast as Grant Ward. Dalton gained 15 pounds (6.8 kg) of muscle before the start of filming for the role. In December, Chloe Bennet was chosen out of more than 400 actresses to play Skye, the sixth and final regular for the first season. Bell called the character ""the hardest to find"" since need to be ""the quintessential Whedon heroine–strong, smart, and self-aware"", which was difficult to find in a 20-year old. Skye is revealed in the second season to be Daisy Johnson, and no longer goes by ""Skye"" starting with the third.At San Diego Comic-Con 2014, Nick Blood was announced as cast in the role of Lance Hunter for the second season, while the character of Bobbi Morse was revealed to be appearing. That August, Henry Simmons joined the cast as Alphonso ""Mack"" MacKenzie, a recurring role, and Adrianne Palicki was cast as Morse in a guest role, to first appear in the episode ""A Hen in the Wolf House"". The next month, the entire first season principal cast were confirmed to be regulars for the second season, along with Blood. Palicki joined them with the episode ""Aftershocks"". In February 2015, Luke Mitchell was cast as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring role for the second half of the season.All season-two principal cast members returned for the third season, with Simmons and Mitchell joining them, promoted from their recurring roles. In October 2015, the Inhuman Hive was introduced; for the second part of season three, he possesses the corpse of Grant Ward, again portrayed by Brett Dalton. Also introduced were Natalia Cordova-Buckley and John Hannah, recurring as Elena ""Yo-Yo"" Rodriguez and Holden Radcliffe, respectively. Blood and Palicki left the main cast following the season-three episode ""Parting Shot"", to star in the then-planned spin-off show Marvel's Most Wanted. Dalton and Mitchell also left following the deaths of their characters in the third-season finale.Gregg, Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, and Simmons returned for the fourth and fifth seasons. They were joined by Hannah in the fourth, with Cordova-Buckley once again recurring as Rodriguez in the season, before being promoted to a series regular for the fifth season. Dalton returned as a guest during the third pod of the fourth season, while Blood made his return to the series during the fifth season. Introduced in the fifth season was Jeff Ward, who recurred as Deke Shaw.Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, Simmons, and Cordova-Buckley return for the sixth and seventh seasons, and were joined by Ward. Given the events of the final episode of season five, in which it is implied that Coulson dies, Gregg noted ""there is some interest in having me involved in"" the sixth season, potentially with flashback, and was also unsure if he would be a series regular, should he return, as he had been for the previous five seasons. Gregg ultimately returned as a series regular in season six playing a new character, Sarge. For season seven, Gregg portrays a Life Model Decoy (LMD) version of Coulson, while De Caestecker is absent for much of the season due to scheduling conflicts with prior commitments, first appearing in the season's eleventh episode; he is credited as a special guest star for his appearances in the season.

Section: Costumes (3):
Betsy Heimann was the costume designer for the pilot, but left the series because of film commitments. Assistant costume designer Ann Foley took over for subsequent episodes, and worked closely with Tancharoen to create ""very strong, different characters"" whose ""looks evolve along with the show."" Foley also brought on concept artists Phillip Boutte Jr. and Josh Shaw to assist with the design process. Foley watched every MCU film, paying special attention to The Avengers, and was also inspired by such films as Skyfall and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. In October 2016, Foley said that she was specifically following the aesthetic of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, ""So any costume has to fit inside that world we've established and has to fit that tactical look."" On the variety of costumes created for each character, Foley preferred to have set pieces in the characters' ""closets"", as ""it's not a fashion show ... a guy like Ward isn't going to have twenty jackets in his closet. He is going to have one that he uses all of the time.""After reading each script, Foley would do her own research, before discussing the look of the episode with the writers. She then studied the comics, general fashion, and history to get a look that is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series. Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging because of the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule. Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not. Marvel CCO Joe Quesada is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters, including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume, which is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake ""could easily be part of the Avengers"". Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow costumes from the films, but was ""flattered"" by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about showing that characters such as Quake ""don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women"", and so avoided ""a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality.""The costumes go through a natural evolution in the series. There is a shift at the end of the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have ""definitely grown up"" during the second season. In the third season there is another shift, ""from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [a] more precise militaristic outfit"". This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from ""a much lighter tone, much more patterns"" in the first season to having ""stripped away a bit of color"" by the third. Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable. With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that ""each season definitely has its own feel and this season will be no different. I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters""; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become ""more adult looking"", while all the cast had ""a pretty specific ... civilian look"" that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public. Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on the television series Altered Carbon, and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to ""blend in"" with Foley's established look. Foley returned for the first two episodes of the fifth season, before handing costume design over to Whitney Galitz, who had assisted Foley on the previous few seasons, and Christann Chanell. Galitz eventually became sole costume designer for the series, before being joined by Jessica Torok during season seven. Torok took over for the second half of the season after Galitz left the series to give birth to her daughter.

Section: Practical effects (3):
The series' props department is led by Scott Bauer. The pilot introduces the Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railgun, or ICER, tranquilizer weapons often used by the agents, with Joss Whedon having Bauer design ""sci-fi""-looking guns, including a large rifle-like weapon. The series' further portrayal of the ICERs was more subtle, with Bauer using airsoft guns that are safe to shoot others with over a small distance. ICER-specific muzzle flashes are then added by the visual effects department. Bauer reused the ICER rifle prop when making Mack's ""Shotgun Ax"", which appears in later seasons. The terrigen crystals that unlock Inhuman abilities in the series are 3D-printed from solid resin and then altered with extra details. Additional practical effects and props are created by Legacy Effects, who also work on the MCU films, notably creating Daisy Johnson's gauntlets for the third season. Prosthetic makeup for the series is designed in conjunction with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios. Hetrick began work on the series with the second season, to create Raina's Inhuman look, and returned for the third season to design and create the more unusual-looking Inhumans such as Lash.

Section: Title sequence (3):
Throughout the series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ""[became] known for its signature use of changing title cards"" to reflect the storyline being told and would define ""a specific era of the series"". The third season introduces a new title sequence for the series, replacing the one that appeared in the first two seasons. The title sequence in ""4,722 Hours"" is drastically different from the design introduced for the third season, with the series' title in the episode's typeface silently fading onto the screen over the back drop of the planet Simmons is stranded on. The fourth season sees new series title cards for the Ghost Rider and LMD pods, and an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. title card for the Agents of Hydra pod that changes to say Agents of Hydra for episodes primarily set in the Framework. The Ghost Rider graphic is used again for the fourth-season finale.For the fifth season, the opening of ""Orientation"" is reminiscent of the sequence for ""4,722 Hours"", forgoing the title card and having the typeface silently fading onto the screen. The subsequent episodes of season five feature a title card with the series name in a new typeface against a backdrop of various depictions of Earth: episodes through ""Past Life"" feature a destroyed future Earth; episodes from ""Principia"" through ""The Devil Complex"" feature a present Earth; while episodes from ""Rise and Shine"" through ""All Roads Lead..."" feature the Earth beginning to crack. Each episode of season seven features a different title card and opening to reflect the time period and genre of the episode.

Section: Filming (2):
Production for the pilot took place almost entirely in Los Angeles to accommodate Joss Whedon's schedule, while the rest of the series is primarily filmed at Culver Studios in Culver City, California. Additional filming has also taken place around the world, including in Paris, France, Stockholm, Sweden, and Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. used the working title R.A.G.T.A.G. throughout its production. The series is filmed on Arri Alexa cameras, with David Boyd serving as director of photography on the pilot, and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing so throughout the rest of the series. Garry Brown is the second unit director for the series, with stunts coordinated by Tanner Gill. The series is filmed in 2K resolution.

Section: Visual effects (2):
FuseFX serves as the lead visual effects vendor for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., with additional work by Pixomondo, Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic. The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episode, with 10 to 12 days to work on the effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming. This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season. Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series. David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for ""Pilot"" through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes. VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015. Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time. Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects. Some assets, such as a Quinjet and Helicarrier, are shared from Industrial Light & Magic, though ""those models are generally super heavy and dense with data"" and need to be made ""HD friendly or simply manageable to work in [a] TV schedule.""

Section: Music (2):
Bear McCreary confirmed that he would compose music for the series in July 2013. Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to work with a full symphonic orchestra, typically featuring 50 or 70 players, with over 90 for ""important"" episodes. Orchestra recording for the series occurred at Warner Bros. Studios' Eastwood Stage, Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage, and Twentieth Century Fox Studios' Newman Scoring Stage. Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score ""a modern edge"".Since Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was ""a sense that it had to connect"" to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens. McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode. Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound—""something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe"" but also ""intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people."" McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted ""the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... [E]lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation.""In 2014, after working as an intern for McCreary, Jason Akers was asked to provide additional music for the series. McCreary hired Akers as a full time staff member in 2015, and he began to have more artistic input into the series' music. Akers is credited as co-composer alongside McCreary for the seventh season. Some of McCreary's favorite pieces from the series included ""Cello Concerto"" from ""The Only Light in the Darkness"", and pieces that had ""massive deviations"" such as music for Ghost Rider, the Framework reality, and going to outer space.

Section: Original soundtrack album (3):
In September 2014, McCreary announced that there were plans for an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. soundtrack, which was released digitally a year later by Marvel Music on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9. Featuring music from the first two seasons, the soundtrack was written and produced by McCreary and Steven Kaplan, with the album produced by Joe Augustine with McCreary. All music composed by Bear McCreary. McCreary's wife, Raya Yarbrough, provides the vocals in ""Alien DNA"". The episode column in the table below indicates which episode(s) the music was featured in.
Regarding the release of additional music from the series, McCreary said in August 2020 there were no immediate plans but would ""love for that to happen"", given he had been waiting until the series concluded to assess everything that had been produced for any potential future releases. He also hoped to get fan input regarding pieces of music they would like to hear on a release in addition to the tracks McCreary would want.

Section: Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins (2):
In July 2013, Jed Whedon said the series would work in tandem with the Marvel films, both past and upcoming, to weave in between the films, and to ""try to make them more rewarding on both ends."" He explained that each Marvel project is intended to stand alone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has to work with the film division and be aware of their plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe. Bell elaborated that this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa. He stated that ""ABC and Marvel both want the series to be able to make sense on its own"", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any ""gaps"" for them, due to having to be ""big"" and moving ""quickly through a lot of huge pieces"", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.In January 2016, Joss Whedon noted that this process ""unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers."" He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability to connect with the films changed over the life of the series, Jed Whedon said, ""The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open."" He added, ""We have relatively free rein [in what the series can introduce and connect to]; we just can't go anywhere that [the films are] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told ""no"" that much"". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as ""something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU.""The series mimics the films' post credits scenes with 'end tags', starting with the episode ""0-8-4"" which features a Samuel L. Jackson cameo. Bell explained, ""Sometimes it'll be funny, sometimes it'll be a mythology thing ... or an extra little reveal about"" the episode. The end tag for ""End of the Beginning"" is a ""directly lifted"" scene from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The series' first major tie-in episode with the wider MCU was ""The Well"", which begins immediately after Thor: The Dark World. The episodes ""End of the Beginning"" and ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" revolve around the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which led to a retooling of the series. Flashback sequences in ""Shadows"" and ""The Things We Bury"" featuring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter served as marketing and set-up for the Agent Carter television series. The events of ""The Frenemy of My Enemy"" and ""The Dirty Half Dozen"" led up to the opening sequence of Avengers: Age of Ultron, while ""Scars"" deals with the aftermath of that film. The third season follows similar themes to the film Captain America: Civil War, focusing on powered people and the different responses to them, leading up to the episode ""Emancipation"", which takes place after the film and shows how its events affect the series' powered characters.The episode ""T.A.H.I.T.I."" introduces the Kree alien race to the MCU, members of which play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something ""in the works"" for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be ""one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film."" The third season introduces the concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the ""writer and director [of the Inhumans film] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that."" When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had ""a little more freedom"" and were ""able to do a little bit more"" with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the ""classic"" Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It was not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.The fourth season explores the concept of Life Model Decoys, which were first referenced in The Avengers, and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU. On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously did not want to explore the concept before the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that ""with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe is moving into new waters,"" referring to the exploration of magic. ""We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift."" The season also continues storylines from the second season of Agent Carter, with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU. The last four episodes of season five take place over a single day, and coincide with the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018). In August 2017, Emily VanCamp said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of Sharon Carter for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series Revenge.Season seven sees Enver Gjokaj reprise his role as Strategic Scientific Reserve agent Daniel Sousa from Agent Carter. The quantum realm is also featured in the season, with Fitz using it to travel to the altered timeline created during the season and reunite with the S.H.I.E.L.D. team before bringing everyone back to the main timeline. Whedon added that, with this introduction into the series, they planned to mention how the realm could be used to survive the snap from Thanos, as seen in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame (2019), but was ultimately cut.In May 2020, Bennet called Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ""the black sheep of the Marvel Universe"" since ""everyone was aware of the fact that we were supposed to be one thing when we started"" and ultimately, the writers ""had to side-step"" many potential opportunities in order to not conflict with the plans for the films. Henstridge also added that in past seasons, all of the episodes had to be reviewed to ensure they would not show something the films would be covering, but for the final season, ""there was just such a sense of just abandon"" with all the ideas the writers came up with allowed to happen. Ahead of the series finale in August 2020, Gregg and Wen looked back at the early tie-ins the series had in season one. Both felt having to wait until the release of The Winter Soldier resulted in the early episodes ""treading water"" and ""hampered the writers"" creativity. Despite this, Gregg did feel the end of season one ""holds up really well"" once the Hydra twist was revealed. Both added the series took off once the writers were less tied to the MCU films and were able to focus on the stories of the characters in the series. Following the series finale, Bell looked back on the series and felt because of all the restrictions it faced from Marvel Studios until the Hydra reveal, it was ""a tech series"" when the audience was expecting ""a superhero show with a lot of Marvel brand names"". Tancharoen added that the series was ""more case-of-the-week"" when it first premiered, but that allowed them to plant various story devices that could be fully explored once they got past the Hydra reveal. Bell also revealed the series at one point had been given permission to use the character MODOK before Marvel retracted their access the character, hoping to work it into their storyline with Anton Ivanov / The Superior in season four. The series had also tried to incorporate the space-based counterpart organization, S.W.O.R.D., but was stopped from doing this by Marvel.

Section: Viewership and ratings (2):
In the United States, the premiere episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. earned a 4.7/14 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, with 12.12 million total viewers, making it the biggest network drama debut in four years. Though the series debuted to strong ratings against its competition, NCIS, its ratings declined considerably over the following two months, though it remained Tuesday's top show among men 18–49, and overall was the No. 3 show among upscale young adults behind Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory. It also enjoyed DVR recordings that, according to TV Guide, were ""through the roof"".In March 2016, Alisha Grauso of Forbes discussed the series and its ratings, describing the show as having ""never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be... It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within the continuity of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing."" Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the Marvel-Netflix shows) or on just being ""support and tie-in to the world of the Avengers"". Grauso concluded, ""The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world.""In November 2018, Parrot Analytics, which measures ""how viewers interact with a TV show's brand online, assessing everything from global file-sharing and peer-to-peer traffic to social media activity"", ranked Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the top 0.03 percent of in-demand television series worldwide, classify it as ""Amazing"". Series with similar demand included Better Call Saul, Criminal Minds, and Vikings, while Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. had higher demand than series such as The Originals, Supergirl, Arrow, and Fear The Walking Dead. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. saw the season seven episode ""A Trout in the Milk"" earn a series low rating of 0.2 in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, while fellow season seven episode ""Brand New Day"" earned the lowest initial viewers with 1.25 million.

Section: Analysis (2):
The way that the series is affected by the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier has been called ""miraculous"", with Terri Schwartz at Zap2it writing ""the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven"", while Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times stated that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ""faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination."" The fact that the series also depicts the rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the MCU has also been highlighted, with Merrill Barr, reviewing ""Beginning of the End"" for Forbes, saying ""what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is 'everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.'""The series' introduction of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club as making Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. an essential part of the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with ""stuff"" happening in the films, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. dealing with the fallout of it. However, the series would now be ""making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU"". Barr wrote that the series ""does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame [of the second season finale], all anyone—Marvel fan or otherwise—will be asking is when season three begins.""The third season's paralleling of themes from Captain America: Civil War was called ""topical and relevant"" and ""downright eerie"" by The A.V. Club's Alex McCown and Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick. McCown compared the series' approach to setting up ""a world distrustful of superpowers"" to the real life events surrounding Cliven Bundy and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and said that ""S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking full advantage of its medium in order to tell the story the upcoming Captain America film can't: A full and fraught exploration of the need to protect freedom and privacy, even for those with extraordinary abilities."" Fitzpatrick added that this ""topical bent...made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies.""Ahead of the fourth season, Collider's Kayti Burt opined that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is ""the X-Men TV show you should be watching"". Burt noted that the X-Men film franchise was expanding to television with the series Legion, but that S.H.I.E.L.D. already served that purpose well, highlighting the similarities between the X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who ""are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains"", and face ""the same fears and prejudices"" from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Inhumans and the X-Men became ""particularly pointed"" in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film X-Men: Apocalypse that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that S.H.I.E.L.D. executed the storyline ""much better"" than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series' diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the mutant cure storyline, the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of Rogue in the first X-Men film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it ""not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most X-Men-like quality."" Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to 20th Century Fox holding the rights, ""we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through S.H.I.E.L.D.""Additionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant discussed how the series ""continues to resist a status quo"", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to the fallout from the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced ""to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it has absolutely no control over."" He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which would not be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, ""there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly staking out new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate.""During the Agents of Hydra pod in the fourth season, Collider.com's Evan Valentine noted how ""[o]ne of the prevalent themes of this latter half of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s fourth season has been its jabs at the current Trump administration... When all's said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it's done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We need to be able to laugh at what's going on in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but S.H.I.E.L.D. has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season.""Ahead of the seventh and final season Shakeema Edwards of Vulture felt the series had ""evolved into a science-fiction fantasia... exploring human mutation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, space exploration, time travel, and even magic"". Edwards continued, ""what’s most fascinating about S.H.I.E.L.D. as it enters its endgame is how it’s committed to the practice of essentially adopting a new subgenre every ten or so episodes, particularly later in its run"". By constantly shifting its genre focus allowed the series to have fewer ""filler episodes"" and could ""maintain its momentum within and between seasons"". Additionally, ""the characters’ ever-deepening devotion to each other has served as an emotional through line, a constant for the characters (and viewers) to hold on to as the narrative rapidly changes around them."" Edwards concluded: ""S.H.I.E.L.D. is going out on its own terms with season seven, a coveted planned conclusion in a television landscape rife with sudden cancellations. Fittingly, the show that originally brought the world of the MCU to the small screen will also serve as an outro to the cinematic universe's first phase in television"".

Directed by Shinsuke Sato, the series stars Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya as allies trapped in an abandoned Tokyo where they are forced to participate in dangerous games, the type and difficulty of which are determined by playing cards. Those surviving each game receive ""visas"", which are extended the more they play; if the visas expire, the individuals are executed.
First announced in July 2019, each episode of the series was written by Sato, Yoshiki Watabe, and Yasuko Kuramitsu. Filming began in August and concluded that same year in December, with locations including various districts of Shibuya, and a green screen studio serving as a replica of the popular Shibuya Crossing, where a large portion of the series takes place. In an international collaboration, Japan's Digital Frontier worked with teams from Singapore, the United States, and India to add post-credit visual effects, with the music featured in the series being composed by Yutaka Yamada, a frequent collaborator with Sato.
Alice in Borderland premiered on Netflix on December 10, 2020, where it was met with positive reviews from viewers and critics for its visuals, cinematography, editing, and use of graphic violence, with some comparing the series to the films Battle Royale (2000) and Cube (1997). Two weeks after the first season was released, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.","Section: Cast and characters (1):

On July 16, 2019, Netflix announced that they were creating a live-action adaptation of the manga Alice in Borderland, with Yoshiki Watabe, Yasuko Kuramitsu, and Shinsuke Sato writing the scripts for each episode, and Sato directing in an attempt of making the show appear as ""one very, very long film"". A few months later, on August 4, Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya were cast as the main characters of the series, with the pair appearing as Ryōhei Arisu and Yuzuha Usagi, respectively.

Section: Filming (2):
Filming for the series began as early as August 2019, when Yamazaki was spotted during filming in Dōgenzaka, a district of Shibuya on August 8. The following day, crew members were spotted near a store in Fukutomi-cho, located in the city of Yokohama. From September 17, to September 20, Yamazaki and Tsuchiya were seen filming in an apartment complex in front of Kita-Suzurandai Station, on the Shintetsu Arima Line, in the city of Kobe. According to the production company Robot Communications, the show's script was revised to ""match the building layout."" A scene from the premiere episode featuring Yamazaki's character, Arisu, meeting his friends Chōta and Karube near Tokyo's busy Shibuya Crossing, was originally supposed to be filmed inside a Starbucks. However, due to the complexity of a glass-covered set, the scene took place in front of a sign outside Shibuya Station. Furthermore, a scene taking place inside the Shibuya Station, in which the main characters enter a bathroom and reemerge to an empty Tokyo, was shot in a four-minute continuous take. Extras were recruited for the series from August 9, to December 11, in various cities. The creator of the original manga the series is based on, Haro Aso, was also allowed to visit various sets. Filming took place in several cities and concluded in December 2019.

Section: Visual effects (2):
During filming, scenes focusing on the empty city of Tokyo were primarily shot using special effects and extensive uses of green screens, with Sato explaining that with the help of his assistant director, he would run into the middle of the intersection of Shibuya Crossing with a small camera ""to figure out which parts to actually build and which parts to CGI."" Using the Ashikaga Scramble City Studio, a large set 100 kilometers from Tokyo constructed for the series and the film Detective Chinatown 3 (which was filmed during the same period), scenes featuring Shibuya Crossing were filmed using mainly green screens, with ""everything but the road and the ticket gate at the east entrance [being] produced with computer graphics"". To keep the scenes ""authentic"", visual effects director Atsushi Doi recreated the shadows of the Tokyu Building where they would normally fall. A scene in episode 4, which showed an underpass being flooded with water, was created with the help of previsualizations, which allowed the show's crew to ""experiment with different elements before the actual shoot."" The panther that appears in that same episode was created using visual effects developed after the crew visited multiple zoos. Additionally, Academy Award winner Erik-Jan de Boer supervised the production of the tiger featured in episode 5, which was created by Anibrain, an animation studio in India. Post-credit visual effects were added in with the help of Japan's Digital Frontier, who worked alongside teams from Singapore, the United States, and India in an international collaboration.

Following its release, Alice in Borderland received mostly positive reviews from critics, who applauded the visuals, cinematography, editing, the performances of Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya, and its use of graphic violence, but left mixed opinions on its advancement without special focus on character development, and its story in general, particularly in the second half. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of Alice in Borderland holds an approval rating of 83% based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10.From The Japan Times, James Hadfield gave the series a star rating of two stars and a half out of five, praising Shinsuke Sato's directing, but criticizing the characters, stating that ""few of the cast leave much impression, though Tsuchiya makes for an effective action heroine, and Nijirô Murakami has some fun as a smirking loner."" Writing for Ready Steady Cut, Jonathon Wilson gave the show a rating of four stars out of five, lauding the series for skipping over ""exposition and careful backstory-building"", and ""just getting straight to it."" Wilson also compared the series positively to the Japanese film Battle Royale, and the American horror film Saw. Ars Technica journalist Jennifer Ouellette called the show ""emotionally intense"", and compared the show's games to those found in the books Ready Player One and Lord of the Flies, and in the 1997 film Cube. Salon's Melanie McFarland compared the series to the CBS All Access miniseries The Stand, stating that Alice in Borderland ""handles the mechanics of introducing its characters more effectively and it doesn't throw off the audience by leaning heavily on flashbacks [...] but unlike ""The Stand,"" the ""before"" profiles aren't extensive to the point of dragging on the story's progress."" From Yahoo! News, Lim Yian Lu highly praised the series for its ""suspenseful plot"", stating that it ""will keep you entertained and yearning for more despite its grisly and gory scenes."" Writing for the Anime News Network, Theron Martin gave Alice in Borderland an overall grade rating of a C+, giving mixed feedback to the show's production, score, general storyline and acting, but stating that it gives a ""modest amount of entertainment"" for its runtime. After watching the first episode of the series, and praising it for its tone, soundtrack, and its ability to ""shift gears so fast"", the crew at Decider recommended viewers to stream the show.

TV writer Andrew Goldberg and screenwriter-directors Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin approached Nick Kroll, Goldberg's best friend since childhood, with the idea to develop a show about going through puberty. Kroll and Goldberg used their divergent pubertal experiences as a centerpiece of the show, because Kroll was a late bloomer while Goldberg went through the physical changes of puberty very early. Many of their lived experiences are featured in the show, such as Kroll's first kiss, and Goldberg's parents waxing his mustache. The show also includes an experience of their childhood friend, Lizzie, who the character of Jessi is based on, getting her first period on a school trip to the Statue of Liberty. According to Kroll in an interview on NPR, Big Mouth ""takes an equal look at what it's like for girls and women, the process of going through puberty, which I think has not been quite as explored in most popular culture.""

Daniel Hart of Ready Steady Cut described the second season as ""more fruitful and more emotional"" and wrote: ""while the previous instalment gave it a larger dose of comedy, there’s more respect for the community’s work in this season; there’s an understanding that the world of dominatrix fulfils the pleasure of many that it is not just a space for whips and leather"".

Section: Controversy (2):
After the release of the first season, the series suffered several criticisms by the BDSM community for containing a high level of inaccuracy. According to BDSM workers, the series' humor revolves around mistaken stereotypes and does not accurately portray the reality of BDSM.BDSM experts characterize Tiff as cold and aggressive, not knowing how to separate the dominatrix personality from the everyday personality. In addition, the series attempts to use a history of sexual trauma to justify Tiff's preference for domination fetishes, a view that is considered cliché and misguided about sex workers. The lack of negotiation and consent in several scenes in the first season and the collar with ""Ring of O"", a symbol of BDSM submission, being used by the protagonist are also other problems pointed out by BDSM professionals.Shortly after the first season's release, one of the series' creators, Rightor Doyle, responded to negative criticism by stating that he would listen to the BDSM community to fix the inaccuracies shown in the series so far. With that, they hired as consultant Olivia Troy, a writer who has worked with BDSM for 15 years, to assist them in the script for the second season. This caused most of the negative points pointed out in the first season to be corrected, making the series closer to the reality of BDSM.According to Troy, the lack of consent, communication and connection between dominatrix and submissive is one of the main mistakes made by the media when BDSM is addressed. But despite the evolution of the second season, Troy also states that there are still some moments that are not necessarily realistic because the theme must fit into the style and script of the show.The actress Zoe Levin said she initially accepted the role not knowing how the work of a dominatrix really is. But after seeing all the negative reviews the series received in the first season, she went with consultant Olivia Troy to BDSM studios to learn about the equipment, philosophy and ethical principles adopted by the BDSM community. When asked what message the second season brings to the audience, Levin said ""the hope is that they see BDSM and sex work and bondage in a different light than they normally do. Because, what we have seen in TV and film is the very stereotypical version of what we only think BDSM is"".

On July 20, 2018, Netflix announced that Shonda Rhimes would produce the Bridgerton series based on Julia Quinn's bestselling novels, while Chris Van Dusen would be showrunner. Quinn explained on The Tamron Hall Show that when she heard from her agent that Rhimes was interested in adapting her novels, she ""almost fell off of [her] stool"", and quickly agreed to the offer. On June 19, 2019, Julie Andrews was cast as Lady Whistledown, whose voice-overs explain much of the series' action. Van Dusen said in a Shondaland article: ""I think [period shows] are considered a bit traditional and conservative. With Bridgerton, I wanted to take everything I loved about a period show and turn it into something fresh, topical, and relatable."" On January 21, 2021, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.

In September 2017, it was reported that a live-action television series based on the comic book Chilling Adventures of Sabrina was being developed for The CW by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions, with a planned release in the 2018–19 television season. The series would be a companion series to Riverdale. Lee Toland Krieger would direct the pilot, which would be written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. Both are executive producers along with Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Jon Goldwater. In December 2017, the project had moved to Netflix under a yet-to-be-announced new title. Two seasons, comprising ten episodes each, have been ordered by the streaming service; this was later altered to be one, 20-episode season split across two parts. CW President Mark Pedowitz stated that Netflix's ability to offer a two-season commitment enticed Warner Bros. Television to move the series to the streaming service. In early May 2018, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina was officially confirmed as the series' title. The series was inspired by ""slow-burn horror"" films such as The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and other ""great satanic horror movies from the 1960s and 1970s"". The opening title sequence features the art of Robert Hack, the original artist of the comic book series.On November 12, 2018, Netflix announced that the eleventh episode of the twenty episodes ordered would be released as a Christmas special episode. It was not always the plan for the series to have a Christmas-themed episode. During production of the first episode of the second part, Aguirre-Sacasa realized that the series had already done episodes related to Halloween and Thanksgiving in the first part, and decided to create the episode. He noted the episode ""was by and large self-contained, but that there are still elements that carry it through and the realizations and relationships and mythology — it sort of threads the needle. And so we figured out a story that could do both."" The episode was also helpful for Netflix, who wanted some sort of additional, standalone content to release between the first two parts. On December 18, 2018, Netflix renewed the series for a second season of 16 episodes, which was also split into two parts. On July 8, 2020, Netflix cancelled the series, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Section: Filming (2):
Filming for the first part began on March 19, 2018, just as filming of the second season of Riverdale concluded, which allowed the same crew members to work on both series. The first two parts were filmed back-to-back, with filming on the second part concluding on December 21, 2018. Filming had been expected to begin in February 2018 and last until June 2018. The first episode of the second part was the eleventh episode filmed, while the Christmas special was the twelfth episode filmed, despite the Christmas special being released as the eleventh episode overall in the series. This was because the idea for the Christmas special came about when the first episode of the second part was ""too far down the line"" to alter its production schedule. Despite the production switch, Aguirre-Sacasa said the first episode of the second part was written ""as a premiere episode for the second part"" and helps kick-off the storylines for the part. Production on the second season, consisting of the third and fourth parts, began on May 17, 2019, and concluded on February 22, 2020.

Section: Connection to Riverdale (2):
The series was originally conceived as a companion series to Riverdale when it was in development for The CW; however, after the series was moved to Netflix, it was unclear if any connection would remain. In January 2018, CW president Mark Pedowitz noted that, ""at the moment, there is no discussion about crossing over."" In March 2018, Jon Goldwater confirmed that the two series were ""two separate entities for right now"" but ""would love it if they could figure out a way to cross over."" Goldwater also felt there was a possibility for the characters to appear on future episodes of Riverdale, since Greendale had already been mentioned as existing on that series.Sabrina's town, Greendale, is introduced in the second season of Riverdale. Following that, several references to the two cities are made regularly in the two series, visually or with dialogues. In the first season of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Moses Thiessen reprises his role as Ben Button from Riverdale during an episode. In the episode ""Chapter Sixty-Seven: Varsity Blues"" from the fourth season of Riverdale, Ty Wood reprises his role as Billy Marlin from Sabrina.In episode ""Chapter Twenty-Three: Heavy Is the Crown"" from the third part of Sabrina, the teenage witch and her cousin visit Riverdale in search for a crown that was owned by Benjamin Blossom, an ancestor of Cheryl. On their way, they pass the town sign. On its back, Jughead Jones spray painted the message ""JJ Wuz Here"", his signature. Three episodes later, a member of the Southside Serpents is attacked by Hilda Spellman.In episode ""Chapter Thirty-Four: The Returned"" from the fourth part of Sabrina, a battle-of-the-bands poster lists the ""Fred Heads"" as an entrant in the competition. This was the name of the high school garage band of Archie's father Fred Andrews.
Regarding a proper crossover, Aguirre-Sacasa said in October 2018 he would ""hate [for a crossover] to never happen"" between the two series, adding that a potential idea for one would see the characters of Riverdale ""hear[ing] about a haunted house in Greendale and try[ing] to break in and it's Sabrina's house"". He also stated that since both series were already established, a crossover could happen in a standalone film with both casts, potentially titled Afterlife with Archie, based on the Archie Horror comic book series of the same name.

In November 2018, Satanic Temple activists sued the series' production team over the use of the Statue of Baphomet, which they claim was a direct copy of their own statue and portrayed the Temple in an inaccurate and derogatory way. Temple members were also concerned about the depiction of Satanists as cannibals practicing forced worship. On November 21, 2018, it was confirmed that Satanic Temple and Netflix have amicably settled the lawsuit dispute, with the terms of the deal left undisclosed to the public.

The thematic genesis for Cobra Kai began with two works of pop culture. First, the 2007 music video for the song ""Sweep the Leg"" by No More Kings stars William Zabka (who also directed the video) as a caricature of himself as Johnny, and features references to The Karate Kid, including cameo appearances by Zabka's former Karate Kid co-stars. In a 2010 interview, Zabka jokingly discussed this video in the context of his vision that Johnny was the true hero of the film. Then, in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made guest appearances as themselves in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother (""The Bro Mitzvah""). In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka.

Cobra Kai was greenlit on August 4, 2017, with ten half-hour episodes, written and executive produced by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg. Although the series received offers from Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and AMC, it ultimately ended up on the subscription service YouTube Red. The trio was joined by executive producers James Lassiter and Caleeb Pinkett of Overbrook Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures Television. YouTube Premium released the first season on May 2, 2018 and the second season on April 24, 2019. It renewed the third season, initially for a 2020 release.On May 28, 2020, Deadline Hollywood announced that the series would be leaving YouTube and moving to another streaming platform, ahead of its third-season premiere. As YouTube was not interested in renewing the series for a fourth season, the producers wanted to find a streaming venue that would leave that option open. On June 22, 2020, it was announced that the show would be moving to Netflix. Netflix released the first two seasons on August 28, 2020, and the third season released on January 1, 2021.

Section: Miyagi-Verse (3):
Characters from the original four films The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), The Next Karate Kid (1994) comprise the Miyagi-verse that shapes Cobra Kai. Thus, after the launch of Season 1, Elisabeth Shue (Ali Mills) from The Karate Kid, Tamlyn Tomita (Kumiko) and Yuji Okumoto (Chozen Toguchi) from The Karate Kid II, and Robyn Lively (Jessica Andrews) and Thomas Ian Griffith (Terry Silver) from The Karate Kid III, all discussed their interest in the series.  Sean Kanan (Mike Barnes) (also from Karate Kid III) stated in a 2021 interview (when asked if Barnes will appear in the series) that ""you probably haven't seen the last of him."" Finally, although Hilary Swank (who as Julie Pierce replaced Daniel as Mr. Miyagi's student in The Next Karate Kid), has neither confirmed nor denied her interest, she did acknowledge that it would be a chance to have a ""showdown"" with Ralph Macchio. In December, 2020, the series' co-creators stated that: ""In our writers’ room we speak about literally every character that has appeared in the Miyagi-verse, so it's obvious that we’ve spoken about Julie Pierce. As to whether or not she'll return to the series, that's something you'll just have to wait to find out.""In 2020, Jon Hurwitz clarified that the ""Karate Kid cartoon is not canon. But there is an Easter Egg from it in Season 3,"" in response to the question as to whether ""the Karate Kid animated series [is] official within the Karate Kid universe?"" The Easter Egg was ""the Miyagi-Do shrine, briefly seen at Chozen Toguchi's dojo in Okinawa halfway through the season. The artifacts were recovered by Daniel LaRusso and Mister Miyagi in the short-lived Karate Kid animated series, which ran for thirteen episodes in 1989.""In a 2021 interview with Slashfilm, the writers noted that they will not be using characters from the 2010 film The Karate Kid, as they are not a part of the ""Miyagi-verse"": ""We’ve ruled that out completely. Jackie Chan is mentioned in season 1 of the show as an actor, so I think in our world, Jackie Chan is an actor and a performer. If the characters on our show have seen a movie called The Karate Kid, they’ve seen that one.""

Shortly after the debut of the third season, Jen Yamato of The Los Angeles Times noted that, ""there are now three white men at the center of Cobra Kai, a franchise rooted in and deeply indebted to Eastern tradition."" While she notes that in this season Yuji Okumoto and Tamlyn Tomita reprised their roles from The Karate Kid II, Cobra Kai ""has yet to cast an Asian lead"". She also quoted Ana-Christina Ramon who argues that ""except for the Latino character of Miguel, all the other people of color are outside of that main cast, so it actually doesn’t show as a diverse show in a sense."" Yamato further states that Ralph Macchio ""pushed"" for Tomita and Okumoto's return, and she quotes one of the show's writers, Schlossberg, as stating: ""Having made Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle we’ve been particularly sensitive to Asian American representation in movies and television."" The writers also note that while there are currently no writers of Asian descent on staff, they have turned to Tomita, Okumoto, the stunt coordinator Hiro Koda, and the original Karate Kid screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen for guidance.On January 18, 2021 Gustavo Arnellano of The Los Angeles Times suggested that Cobra Kai offers a ""a way forward for all of us during these tumultuous times"", as he ""saw this uplifting season [3] finale the weekend before the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol invasion. My rage and desire for fire and brimstone in its aftermath were tempered by the lessons that Cobra Kai had just depicted."" He bases his argument on the fact that ""Cobra Kai teaches that the bad guys and girls of the world shouldn’t be vanquished but rather brought into the light of good — deprogrammed instead of defeated. There are profound insights about repentance, redemption, forgiveness for past sins and unity in the face of existential evil.""In a February 2021 column for the Hollywood Reporter, former NBA champion and student of martial arts Kareem Abdul-Jabbar suggests that his friend and teacher, the late Bruce Lee, was linked to the influence of the original Karate Kid films. He also argues that Lee “would have loved [Cobra Kai] because he saw martial arts not just as a way to defend against enemies, but as a way to defend against one’s own self-destructive impulses.” Although he states that Lee might have been ""mildly disappointed"" in the ""portrayal of the actual martial arts moves"", which may reflect the fact that Cobra Kai is a family show (as well as the lack of involvement of teachers in the school fights), he states that these are minor areas, outweighed by its reflection of Lee’s belief that ""martial arts heals because it helps one identify their problems and adapt to solving them"".

Following the selling of his spec script for Wes Craven-directed Scream (1996), film assistant Kevin Williamson was taking several meetings with film and television producers before the slasher film began production. In what would be his first television meeting, Williamson met executive Paul Stupin and, when asked if he had ideas for a television production, Williamson came up with the idea of a teen series based on his youth growing up near a North Carolina creek as an aspiring filmmaker who admired director Steven Spielberg. Stupin liked his idea and asked him to come back the next day and pitch it to Columbia TriStar Television studios, prompting Williamson to write a 20-page outline for Dawson's Creek that night. Williamson pitched the show ""as Some Kind of Wonderful, meets Pump Up the Volume, meets James at 15, meets My So-Called Life, meets Little House on the Prairie"", also taking inspiration from teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210 as he ""wanted it to speak to the teenage audience of the day"".When Columbia requested him to relocate the show to Boston, Massachusetts, he settled with fictional Capeside, and pitched it to Fox. However, commissioned amid the struggling of Party of Five, Fox wondered if they needed another teen drama, and while they were supportive of Williamson's scripts, they eventually passed on it. Left unused, Columbia TriStar sent his scripts to newly founded The WB network who was looking for fresh ideas for their programme after launching supernatural drama series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Williamson went for a meeting with then-chief programmer Garth Ancier and entertainment president Susanne Daniels who loved his script and picked it up for the network's new Tuesday night lineup. Procter & Gamble Productions joined in as an original co-producer of the series, however, sold its interest in the show three months before the premiere when printed stories surfaced about the racy dialogue and risqué plot lines.

Dawson's Creek would become responsible for launching the acting careers of its young lead stars James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, and Joshua Jackson, who had varying acting experience prior to being cast in the show. Known for his appearance in The Mighty Ducks series, playing a young and aspiring hockey player, Jackson was initially considered for the main role of Dawson Leery. However, while Williamson ""fell in love"" with Jackson, citing his ability to read any role during the auditions, he felt that Jackson's good looks would not fit the underdog, nerd, and video geek character he envisioned for the show's titular character. After The WB expressed their wish to look for a different actor, Williamson decided on casting him in the role of Dawson's best friend Pacey Witter instead. After watching a video of James Van Der Beek that his casting director had sent in, the casting crew invited him to audition in Los Angeles. A regular off-Broadway performer, van der Beek impressed Williamson with his ""cerebral and internal"" quality, citing ""that nervousness that made it seem like he was pre-thinking and over-thinking and over-compensating constantly like he was insecure. And we said, ""There's Dawson""."" Actors Charlie Hunnam, Adrian Grenier, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Scott Speedman also auditioned for the role of Dawson, while Adam Brody read for Pacey.With the role of Dawson's best female friend Joey Potter, casting directors were looking for a tomboy character. Williamson and his team were initially close to casting actress Selma Blair in the role who had auditioned ""very tough, [but] with a lot of heart,"" when an audition tape of Katie Holmes came in, in which she had filmed herself in her basement, with her mother reading Dawson's lines. Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey, citing that ""she had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness."" He asked her to come to California, but a conflict with her school play schedule prevented her from doing so. Upon her arrival in Los Angeles two weeks later, she was able to secure the role. Williams, a regular in low-budget films and commercials, impressed Williamson when she auditioned with a heartfelt scene in which her character Jen Lindely goes in and sees her grandfather lying in the bed, transforming herself ""into this broken child who just needed to be fixed"". Katherine Heigl also was one of the actresses who auditioned for the role of Jen after Steve Miner, who directed the show's pilot and Heigl's 1994 film My Father the Hero, brought in the young star.

Section: Filming locations (2):
During its first four seasons, Dawson's Creek was primarily filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, at EUE/Screen Gems studios and on location around Wilmington, with Southport and Wrightsville Beach also standing in for the fictional town of Capeside, a port city located in mid-Cape Cod. The Wilmington area benefited greatly from the show. While a number of films, commercials and music videos had been shot at the studios, Dawson's Creek was the first to occupy numerous soundstages for many years. Other shows as One Tree Hill later occupied some of those same soundstages for several years and used some of the same locations in Wilmington. In addition to business brought into the community by the project, it attracted attention to the city as a filming location and boosted tourism. The visitors' bureau distributed a special guide to filming locations used in the show.For the Leery, Lindley, and Potter homes private residences located along the shores of Hewletts Creek, a stream in New Hanover County, were used. Some of the scenes shown during the opening credits and miscellaneous scenery shots throughout the early episodes were filmed in Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, as well as Masonboro. Interiors for the Potter family's The Icehouse restaurant were filmed at The Icehouse bar in downtown Wilmington, while exteriors were filmed at the Dockside Restaurant in Wrightsville Beach. Nearby constructions at the real Icehouse later forced producers to eliminate the bar from the storyline by burning it down. Other prominent exterior shots include Alderman Hall on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus, serving for Capeside High School.Due to the architectural uniformity of the campus, it was difficult for the university to double as another campus in the show when the characters reached college in the fifth and sixth season. Therefore, scenes at the fictional Worthington University in Boston were filmed at Duke University and around Franklin Street at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Other filming locations in later seasons include Durham and Raleigh. The Hell's Kitchen bar featured in the show was a natural food store at 118 Princess Street in Wilmington which was purchased by producers, dressed as a seedy college bar and used for production during the show's last season. When production completed, the building was purchased by a local restaurateur, along with much of the set and decorations and was then converted it into a real restaurant and bar. It retains the name as well.

Dawson's Creek generated a large amount of publicity before its debut, with several television critics and consumer watchdog groups expressing concerns about its anticipated ""racy"" plots and dialogue. The controversy drove one of the original production companies away from the project.John Kiesewetter, television columnist for The Cincinnati Enquirer, wrote, ""As much as I want to love the show—the cool kids, charming New England setting, and stunning cinematography—I can't get past the consuming preoccupation with sex, sex, sex."" In his defense, Williamson denied this was his intention, stating that ""I never set out to make something provocative and racy"".Syndicated columnist John Leo said the show should be called ""When Parents Cringe,"" and went on to write ""The first episode contains a good deal of chatter about breasts, genitalia, masturbation, and penis size. Then the title and credits come on and the story begins."" Tom Shales, of The Washington Post, commented that creator Kevin Williamson was ""the most overrated wunderkind in Hollywood"" and ""what he's brilliant at is pandering.""The Parents Television Council proclaimed the show as the single worst program of the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons by being ""the crudest of the network shows aimed at kids"", complaining about ""an almost obsessive focus on pre-marital sexual activity"", references to pornography and condoms, and the show's acceptance of homosexuality. The council also cited it as the fourth worst show in 2000–2001. Former UPN President Lucie Salhany criticized WB for airing Dawson's Creek which features ""adolescent characters in adult situations"" in an early timeslot while the network is supposed to be ""the family network"". However, on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, the National Organization for Women offered an endorsement, deeming it one of the least sexually exploitative shows on the air.
Despite the controversy surrounding the sexual-oriented topics, the show was a major critical success. Before its premiere, San Francisco Chronicle explained the buzz around the show was due to its creator Kevin Williamson who wrote the screenplays for Scream and Scream 2 and that the show might be ""one of the year's tangier hits"". He also found Dawson's Creek scenically ""downright luxuriant"" and liked that it ""doesn't have the rushed feel of so many teen shows. The edginess is in the situations, not the pacing."" Variety wrote that it was ""an addictive drama with considerable heart...the teenage equivalent of a Woody Allen movie—a kind of 'Deconstructing Puberty'"". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called it ""a teen's dream"". The Dayton Daily News listed Capeside as a television town they'd most like to live in. The Seattle Times declared it the best show of the 1997–1998 season and said it ""belongs to the small-pantheon My So-Called Life, James at 15 and to a lesser extent, Party of Five and Doogie Howser, M.D.

Dawson's Creek was nominated for fourteen awards, including ALMA Awards, Casting Society of America Awards, Golden Satellite Awards, TV Guide Awards, and YoungStar Awards. In 2000, the show was awarded a SHINE Award for consistently addressing sexual health issues on TV. By the end of its run, the show, its crew, and its young cast had been nominated for numerous awards, winning six of them. Joshua Jackson won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Actor three times, and the show won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Drama twice. The series also won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Drama Series.

Section: U.S. television ratings (2):
While never a huge ratings success among the general television population, Dawson's Creek did very well with the younger demographic it targeted and became a defining show for the WB Network. The pilot episode was watched by 6.8 million viewers and had a 4.8 rating which was the network's highest rating at the time. The first season's highest ranked episode was the finale, which was fifty-ninth, while the second highest rated was the second episode (probably scoring so well partially because the other major networks carried President Clinton's State of the Union address in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal rather than their regular programming). The finale itself was watched by 7.8 million U.S. viewers, which was its largest audience ever.

14,Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Japan, Aniplex,,,,23,"Adventure,Dark fantasy,Martial arts",1,26,,,,"Ever since the end of reigning titles like Naruto and Bleach, it seems like shonen anime has favored treading new ground and indulging in the wild and exciting, rather than sticking to a standard formula. Amongst new hits are series like The Promised Neverland, a dazzling dystopian thriller, Dr. STONE, a fantasy adventure that’s all about scientific inventions, and We Never Learn, a school life comedy that as sweet as it is romantic.Amongst all of these newcomers, though, is the rather quiet and somewhat under the radar series, Kimetsu no Yaiba, or more commonly known as Demon Slayer. Now adapted by the mighty Ufotable (the studio behind the renowned Fate franchise, including Fate/Zero, Fate/Unlimited Blade Works, and the Heavens Feel movie trilogy), the series has kicked off its training wheels and entered some of the more exciting arcs. With about half its promised run left, Demon Slayer has proven itself to be a fantastic ride that lives up to the hype of its sibling Shonen Jump titles with its high production values and equally compelling story about revenge, redemption, and family.Demon Slayer focuses on young Tanjiro Kamado, a boy living in feudal Japan and whose family deals in selling coal. He lives happily with his brothers and sisters until one day, upon returning home after selling coal, he discovers that all but one of his siblings has been slaughtered by demons. Fueled by grief and rage, he runs back into the woods with his wounded younger sister, Nezuko, only for her to turn into a demon on their way to seek help. To make things worse, she’s instantly targeted by a demon slayer. With his kind heart and words, Tanjiro manages to stop the demon slayer from killing Nezuko, and prevent her from fully losing her humanity. What starts off as an incredibly bad day quickly turns into a quest for Tanjiro to become a Demon Slayer and find a way to bring his sister back to being human.This beginning premise may feel like your standard shonen demon-fighting story, and for an arc or two, Demon Slayer does seem to retread that ground. Tanjiro’s quest to turn his sister back into a human seems like a regular setup for a long journey, and Tanjiro does exhibit many of the stereotypical traits of a shonen hero: he’s lacking in skill and experience, but stubborn and determined to win. Amongst him are companions that are also dramatic in comparison, and the demons he faces, while unique in character design and powers, aren’t necessarily the most memorable. They simply serve as progress marks to help Tanjiro become stronger.But where Demon Slayer kicks off into intriguing and fresh territory is, ironically, Tanjiro. His optimism and kind heart often remind me of Allen Walker from D.Gray-man, who also shared a deep empathy with his foes, going as far as to weep for their souls as he destroyed them in battle. However, whereas Allen’s compassion thematically aligns with his beliefs - he is an exorcist, after all - Tanjiro is a Demon Slayer, and the war he fights is a cruel and merciless one. It is despite this - or perhaps because of it - that his empathy is so striking and powerful. It’s a reminder that bravery does not necessarily mean the ability to stand up after being beaten down: it can also mean compassion for those you fight for and the ones you fight against.There’s also Nezuko, who is incredibly refreshing as a side female protagonist. While Nezuko can speak and carries an innocent-like charm to her behavior, the series takes great steps to advocate for her agency as she helps Tanjiro in his fight against demons. It’s worth mentioning that Nezuko’s help isn’t just mere assistance - she carries her own battles and follows her brother in his quest because she wants to, not because he asks her to. Nezuko and Tanjiro’s sibling relationship is one of the most endearing parts of Demon Slayer, if not arguably its beating heart and soul; they rely on each other, look to each other for inspiration and confidence, and remind each other of humanity and what to fight for. Each moment between them is absolutely wonderful.Demon Slayer’s production values make the anime shine even brighter. Ufotable doesn’t exactly lend it the same care we see it do with the Fate series - I’ll often see replacements of 2D animation with CG when possible, which may be a sign of cutting corners - but the studio makes up for this with stunning color composite and direction. The unique character designs look great too; bold lines and expressions make Tanjiro and other characters stand out. The settings are also neatly detailed, and this plus a solid soundtrack from the iconic Yuki Kajiura (Sword Art Online, Erased) ends up creating a haunting and moving atmosphere.It’s also worth noting that the fights are surprisingly inventive. What starts off as a standard training arc quickly ramps up and diversifies into a battle of speed, deduction, and luck. As Tanjiro’s opponents become increasingly powerful, Tanjiro’s ability to discern and understand his opponents and their actions also becomes more thought out. This results in incredibly well-produced and fun battle scenes – they’re tight, intense, and bear a similar tone to that of the battles you would see from something like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. There’s also an uncommon dash of realism to them. Demon Slayer takes no fault in allowing its protagonists to be bruised, broken, and beat up a little bit, going as far as to mention somewhat realistic healing time.All of these tiny quirks add up to become a big factor: Demon Slayer isn’t as shockingly impressive from the get-go like its Shonen Jump siblings, Dr. STONE, My Hero Academia, or The Promised Neverland. But it also is fully aware that it doesn’t have to be, to keep you hooked: it’s the small things that matter after all, and Demon Slayer has continued to succeed with its brief but powerful moments of action and human (and demon?) drama.",8.7,31790,Positive,0.972

The series is Groening's first production to appear exclusively on a streaming service; he previously created The Simpsons and Futurama for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Set in the medieval fantasy kingdom of Dreamland, the series follows the story of Bean, a rebellious and alcoholic princess, her naive elf companion Elfo, and her destructive ""personal demon"" Luci. Disenchantment stars the voices of Abbi Jacobson, Eric Andre, Nat Faxon, John DiMaggio, Tress MacNeille, Matt Berry, David Herman, Maurice LaMarche, Lucy Montgomery, and Billy West.
The first ten episodes were released on August 17, 2018, and the next ten were released on September 20, 2019. In October 2018, Netflix renewed the series for an additional 20 episodes. The first ten of these were released on January 15, 2021.",,"Section: Production (1):

The series, created by The Simpsons and Futurama creator Matt Groening, ""will bear his trademark animation style"". The series is animated by Rough Draft Studios, the same studio that worked on Futurama. In July 2017, it was announced that rapper Briggs is part of the writing team for the series. John DiMaggio has described the series as ""the offspring of The Simpsons and Game of Thrones."" Groening has said the show has a ""definite feminist point of view.""The series was announced in July 2017, with a 20-episode order, along with multiple members of the cast, at which time it had been in the works at Netflix for at least one year.  The first part of the first season, which consisted of 10 episodes, got a release date of August 17, 2018 in May of that year. In May 2019, the second part's debut was also announced. A second season, spit into two parts like the first, was confirmed in October 2018, after the season one premiere.

Section: Tie-ins (2):
The episode ""Dreamland Falls"" ties into Groening's other series Futurama, implying that both shows do in fact take place in the same universe. When Luci uses the crystal ball to show moments from before, Philip J. Fry, Bender and Professor Farnsworth can briefly be seen in a time machine. The moment is a reference to the episode ""The Late Philip J. Fry"" in which the trio travel in a one-way time machine and witness the end and rebirth of the universe, implying that the three were passing through after time restarted. In the episodes ""Electric Princess,"" ""Steamland Confidential,"" and ""Last Splash,"" among others, Futurama is referenced multiple times. For instance, a boulevard is named after Farnsworth, there is an homage on one of the buildings, to Planet Express, and various locations within the steampunk city of Steamland reference the show, along with various voice actors from Futurama joining the cast of Disenchantment. Others have noted that in the episode ""Steamland Confidential,"" the series references the ""steamed hams"" made by Principal Skinner for Superintendent Chalmers in the April 1996 episode of The Simpsons, titled ""22 Short Films About Springfield"". In the episode ""Beanie Get Your Gun"", Zog displays erratic behavior by making a repeating honking noise which matches the opening melody to a song performed by the band King Missile.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 62% of 89 critic reviews are positive for Part 1, which has an average rating of 6.13/10. The critical consensus reads: ""Disenchantment showcases enough of Matt Groening's trademark humor to satisfy fans—although the show's overall familiarity and disappointing willingness to play it safe may not bode well for future seasons."" According to Metacritic, which calculated an average of 56 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, Part 1 received ""mixed or average reviews"". Forbes called the series ""charming, unique, and excellent."" Ars Technica stated the series starts rocky, but then it gets ""bloody good"". Entertainment Weekly gave the series a ""C"" grade, likening it to an extended ""Treehouse of Horror"" story. Den of Geek gave a more mixed reception of the series, praising the concept, but criticizing some of the jokes. Brian Tallerico from RogerEbert.com wrote the series does not live up to the standards of other Netflix Original animations, but praised its concept and cast, and suggested the series might improve in the future. Reviewing seven of the first season's 10 episodes, Danette Chavez of The A.V. Club gave the series a B-, saying that the strength of the cast made up for weak writing. Upon its initial review, TV Guide gave the series a lukewarm reception. But upon viewing of the last three episodes, the opinion changed, and praised the serialization of the series that paid off in the end. Similarly, Rhuaridh Marr of Metro Weekly called the show disenchanting while saying that it is ""as much a treat to look at as it is to listen to"" while environments which are ""lush and vibrant."" At the same time, Ben Travers on IndieWire said the series starts out ""rough"" but moves into more effective serialized storytelling toward the end of Part 1. Melanie McFarland of Salon.com compared the series to The Simpsons and Futurama, saying the series professes to be feminist, noting that Bean is the embodiment of this, resisting her father's attempts to push her into arranged marriages for political reasons. She also argued that the series doesn't stereotype any ethnic group by having all the characters be painted generically, with Dreamland as a ""non-racial patriarchy,"" with Bean standing up to ""charmless men who stand in her way."" Even so, McFarland wrote that people should be wary of the feminist framing of the show, arguing that Apu Nahasapeemapetilon in The Simpsons embodied racial stereotypes, and said that the show's creators can't say that the show is feminist until at least 50 percent of the writers are women. 
For the second part, Rotten Tomatoes collected 15 reviews and identified 73% as positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The critical consensus reads: ""As Disenchantment's pieces slowly fall into place it grows deeper in character and world building to become a more fully realized show -- if only those pieces would fall just a little bit faster."" Kevin Yeoman of ScreenRant, describing it as a ""considerable step forward in terms of storytelling, plotting, [and] character development"" and an impressive improvement from Part 1. Joyce Slaton of Common Sense Media, reviewing parts 1 and 2, disliked the cartoon violence, rude jokes, and frequent alcoholism, but praised Bean as a ""strong, non-stereotypical character,"" the non-problematic sexual content, and the beautiful animation, while noting that the language is mild. Slaton also claimed that the humor was ""disappointing."" 
Vikram Murthi of The A.V. Club was critical of Part 3, complaining that he was not satisfied with the episodes of the season, while Neal Justin of the Star Tribune pessimistically told readers to ""enjoy it while you can."" Tony La Vella of Gamerant had a similar view, arguing that the series ""feels unfocused"", while admitting that the show is ""slowly laying the pipework to what could...be a satisfying conclusion."" In contrast, Daniel Kurland of Bubble Blabber said that the episodes felt serialized, but praised the location of Steamland for effectively incorporating ""modernity into this fantasy setting"", and called the series fun and ""very competent."" Marcel Schmid, in a German-language publication, described the series as a ""lovingly designed series"" with nice set design, beautiful background painting, effectively mixes ""the Middle Ages with industrialization"", engaging in social commentary, and has effective black comedy. Schmid also argued that the series had improved over time and stated that Steamland ""offers a good contrast to medieval Dreamland."" Additionally, Caitlin Kennedy of Nightmarish Conjurings positively reviewed the series, noting that while in Parts 1 and 2, it has been ""immature in the most fun way possible"", Part 3 went further, showing ""the most growth and more comfortably dabbles in heavier topics in its unfolding epic narrative"", and praises the expansion of the story, especially into places like Steamland, the ""steampunk and technologically advanced counterpart to Dreamland."" Kennedy also argued that Part 3 focused on love, loss, and mental health, while saying she is looking forward to more episodes.

Darren Star has done it yet again: centered an entire show on a thin, gently delusional white woman whimsically exploring a major metropolitan area in wildly expensive couture purchased on a mid-level salary.
Daniel D'Addario of Variety described the series as ""a delight that poses the question of what it really means to grow up, against a truly inviting backdrop"", and that Collins is ""an inherently winsome performer who has never been quite as well used as she is here"". Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a ""B"" and wrote, ""If you need a five-hour brain vacation, Paris is a worthwhile destination."" The New Zealand Herald considered the show ""visually delectable"" and that ""Collins has a pixie-ish charm which makes her endearing"", but also that the show is ""as ephemeral as fairy floss [cotton candy]"".  However, Kristen Lopez of IndieWire wrote a review Metacritic graded as a 23 out of a 100, praising Collins for being a ""jewel, make no mistake"" and that ""Emily in Paris is only as watchable and frivolous as its leading lady,"" but warning viewers ""Emily in Paris is like scrolling through Instagram. It's a great way to waste time looking at pretty pictures with no depth.""Nevertheless, not all critics were kind to the Emily character. Emma Gray from HuffPost called Emily a bland character, stating ""The show doesn't even make an effort to quirk her up or give her a more relatable, girl-next-door roughness: she's always immaculately coiffed and made-up, and garbed in effortfully eye-catching outfits. But there's not much to the character, except for enormous amounts of self-confidence and the inexplicable ability to attract new friends and love interests on every street corner."" Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian gave the series one out of five stars: ""if it is an attempt to fluff up the romcom for the streaming age, then it falls over on its six-inch heels.""Some critics appeared ambivalent, such as Jo Ellison writing for the Financial Times. On one hand she expresses admiration for the way Darren Star manages to depict ""a version of womanhood in which promiscuity, bossiness and shopaholicism are depicted as qualities to be celebrated""; on the other ""the major plot lines might have been written in the 1940s and the Frenchies are routinely cast as vain, preening and parochial."" She concludes ""Cliché-ridden and completely outdated: Darren Star's 'Sex and the Cité' will no doubt be monstrously successful.""Many French critics condemned the show for negatively stereotyping Parisians and the French. Charles Martin wrote in Première that the show unfairly stereotyped and depicted the French as ""lazy [individuals who] never arrive at the office before the end of the morning [...] are flirtatious and not really attached to the concept of loyalty [...] are sexist and backward, and [...] have a questionable relationship with showering"".Megan Garber of The Atlantic was critical of the character Emily, writing, ""An expat who acts like a tourist, she judges everything against the backdrop of her own rigid Americanness. You might figure that those moments are evidence of a show poking fun at its protagonist's arrogance, or setting the stage for her to grow beyond her initial provincialism. But: You would be, as I was, mostly incorrect. Instead, other people change around her. They grudgingly concede that her way (strident, striving, teeming with insistent individualism) is the right way. The show—the latest from the Sex and the City creator Darren Star—is selling several fantasies. Primary among them is the notion that Emily can bulldoze her way through France and be celebrated for it.For the series, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 63% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 5.81/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Though its depiction of France is tré cliché [sic], Emily in Paris is rom-com fantasy at its finest, spectacularly dressed and filled with charming performances."" Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".

",,"The blackest days of winter might feel like the ideal time for another bracing shot of cool Scandi-noir, but Netflix’s Danish series Equinox has no chill. No quirky detectives in enviable knitwear here, striding through attractive low-rise cities and crisp forests to apply logic to crimes of sadness. We’re somewhere wilder and murkier.Astrid (Danica Curcic) is a 30-ish, recently separated mother of one who has been styled according to the TV drama template for a damaged soul. Her mousy hair straggles forlornly, her unwillingness to deviate from plain vests and cardigans is a blatant cry for help, and she has got exactly the job you would expect a character defined by fraught intensity to have: she’s a journalist, hosting a late-night radio phone-in that trades in feverish thoughts and liminal fears.One evening, a disturbing call comes in, prompting a trip back home to Copenhagen to re-investigate the tragedy that destroyed her family when she was a girl. Flashbacks place us in the summer of 1999, when Astrid’s older sister Ida disappeared into thin air, along with a busload of students who had just finished secondary school. Here’s the thing: little Astrid wasn’t surprised when the cops came knocking with bad news, because she had foreseen the calamity in her dreams. Now her visions have started up again, and that shocking phone call is from one of three students who were on the fateful bus ride, but who unaccountably didn’t vanish and have been scarred by the experience. They’re still out there, harbouring secrets Astrid’s imagination might be able to unlock.So begins one of those rabbit-hole yarns where someone who we don’t believe is delusional increasingly seems that way to their anxious loved ones, because most of their evidence is in their head, and the only people who can corroborate their theories have also had their lives blighted by The Event. It’s the sort of show where the hero takes delivery of a Jiffy bag containing an old cassette player and an anonymous note requesting a meeting, and then the meeting turns out to be at a disused fairground. There’s a dash of Ring, a waft of Stranger Things, a memory of The Returned and a flavour of The Da Vinci Code, all brewed into an overall spookiness that covers the many plot holes – most of them of the “main character fails to ask obvious follow-up question” kind – with a smothering fog.That’s fine if it’s just to fix the narrative, but Equinox takes a risk by mixing fantastical gubbins with some dead-serious issues. The young and old Astrid are properly disturbed by their nightmares, and the early episodes in particular are a duck call for viewers who see themselves in a woman dogged by overthinking, anxiety and perhaps even psychosis. Astrid’s mental health is integral to the plot: it’s a riddle wrapped in a diagnosis. Sometimes, it feels as if we’re toying with trauma like a teenager messing with a Ouija board.Equinox also proves to be a show about how differing reactions to loss can pull apart those left behind; about how parents can’t ever be certain that the decisions they make for their children are right, but know the wrong ones can stay with their kids for ever; and about how sad or vulnerable people are susceptible to conspiracy theory and belief in myths. Such recognisable, mundane concerns are, in the best tales about someone who may or may not be experiencing the supernatural, delicately played off against the flickering possibility that magic might actually happen.That’s a balance Equinox doesn’t quite strike. It shows its hand too early and, as the lurid twists pile up and the probability of a satisfying ending falls, the chances of anything useful being said about the characters’ pain – which many viewers might share and recognise – also recedes. We can see the real emotions the show is trying to talk about, but it’s too far gone from reality to feel a proper connection.But Equinox isn’t a full-on exploitation ghost train either.

It is produced by Archery Pictures in association with Rainbow, a studio co-owned by Iginio Straffi and ViacomCBS. Fate was developed by Brian Young, who also acts as the showrunner and executive producer.
Iginio Straffi first proposed a live-action version of Winx Club in 2011, after Viacom (owner of Nickelodeon) became a co-owner of his studio and started financing his projects. Before approving production on the series, Straffi gained experience with live-action television shows, working as a producer for Nickelodeon's Club 57. Principal photography for Fate eventually began in September 2019 in Ireland.
Early in production, Nickelodeon's American crew members from the cartoon (including Bloom's voice actress, Molly Quinn) met with the Fate production team and reviewed the pilot script. Rainbow's Joanne Lee also oversaw the show as an executive producer. Apart from them, the crew behind Fate is entirely new to the Winx franchise, and the writers were recruited from teen dramas like The Vampire Diaries.The series features an ensemble cast based on the characters of the animated show, with Abigail Cowen in the lead role of Bloom. The six-episode first season debuted on Netflix on 22 January 2021 to mixed reviews.
In February 2021, the series was renewed for a second season.","Section: Cast and characters (1):

The idea for a live-action adaptation of Winx Club dates back to 2011. Winx Club creator Iginio Straffi first proposed a live version in May 2011, several months after Viacom (owner of Nickelodeon) became a co-owner of his studio (Rainbow) and started financing his projects. At the Ischia Global Fest in 2013, Straffi stated that he was still planning a production ""with the Winx in flesh and blood, played by real actors. Sooner or later it will be done."" Straffi had only worked on animated productions at the time, so he transitioned his focus to live action, working as a producer for Nickelodeon's live-action show Club 57.In February 2016, Iginio Straffi mentioned that a live-action movie concept was being considered in partnership with Hollywood Gang Productions, but the project never moved on. In March 2018, the idea was revisited as a television series after Netflix ordered a young-adult version for its streaming service. Straffi was involved in the early planning stages, and he declined a suggestion from Netflix for the male characters to be given larger roles.After a pilot episode was scripted, Nickelodeon's American crew members from the cartoon (including Bloom's voice actress, Molly Quinn) travelled to meet with the Fate production team and review the script. Francesco Artibani, one of the Italian writers of the animated version, was also brought in to read the storyline. Rainbow's Joanne Lee oversaw the first season as an executive producer.
The writers behind Fate are entirely new to the Winx franchise, and they were recruited from teen dramas like The Vampire Diaries. Brian Young, who worked on seven seasons of The Vampire Diaries, is the creator and showrunner of Fate: The Winx Saga. According to an interview with The Guardian, Young chose to ""ditch the look"" of the cartoon Winx fairies, who have big eyes and sparkling outfits. He said, ""Look, again, I'm a massive manga anime fan... but nobody looks like that."" Some episodes of the first season were directed by Lisa James Larsson and Hannah Quinn.On 18 February 2021, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 35% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.33/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Flat, flimsy, and forgettable, Fate: The Winx Saga is a fantastical flop that fails to capture the magic of its source material.""Caroline Framke of Variety criticized the series for relying too much on clichés and wrote that “while adapted from an animated show about friends that was largely targeted at pre-teens, it takes a page out of the “Riverdale” book by giving everything an ominous sheen of sexy intrigue.”  Joel Keller from Decider urged the audience to skip the series stating that “while there's nothing inherently terrible about Fate: The Winx Saga, there's nothing about it that stands out. Also, do we need yet another dark and gritty remake of a beloved kids’ series?”.  Deirdre Molumby from Entertainment.ie praised the cast but criticized the plot and the poor CGI quality.  On the contrary, Petrana Radulovic of Polygon wrote that “Fate: The Winx Saga does create a compelling, nuanced plot. The worldbuilding is exciting, offering a spin on the animated series’ world of fairies and non-magical, sword-wielding Specialists”.  Melissa Camacho of Common Sense Media criticized the diversity of the cast along with the teen angst shown in the series, but wrote that “Fate: The Winx Saga offers a story world that is easy to escape into, and easy to get caught up in, if you're looking for a fantastical universe to explore.”  Millie Mae Healy of The Harvard Crimson heavily criticized the series for its deviation from the source material and stated that it “goes out of its way to be less inclusive and compelling than the source material was” and called it “a damn shame”.  Deyshna Pai of the UCSD Guardian gave the series “C+” and criticized its pacing and character development.

The series received backlash over the casting of Applebaum as Musa, who was coded as East Asian and whose character design was based on Lucy Liu, as well as the apparent replacement of Flora, who was coded as Latina and whose character design was based on Jennifer Lopez, with a new white character named Terra.In response to the backlash, Abigail Cowen said she was not involved in the casting but hoped that Flora would be introduced in Season 2 saying “I do think diversity both in front of and behind the camera is vital and much-needed throughout the industry and internationally. So I think it's important that we are having these conversations.”  Brian Young has said Terra is the cousin of Flora, leaving Flora's inclusion in the show a possibility. Elisha Applebaum, who plays Musa also addressed the controversy. ""It's really sad to see that fans were upset with the casting. I wasn't involved in the casting but I hope that what they've seen and how I've portrayed Musa was to their liking,"" Elisha told Digital Spy.

On August 19, 2013, ABC bought from Shondaland Productions the original concept, produced by Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers. The script for the pilot episode was written by Grey's Anatomy supervising producer Peter Nowalk. ABC ordered the pilot on December 19, 2013. On May 8, 2014, ABC picked up the pilot to series for the 2014–15 television season. At the Television Critics Association Press Tour in July 2014, it was announced that How to Get Away with Murder would be a limited series with only 15 or 16 episodes per season. The smaller size of episode count stems from the deal for the series star Viola Davis. On October 9, 2014, ABC picked up the series for a full season of 15 episodes.The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, by ABC. The series was effectively confirmed as earning a second-season renewal for the 2015–16 season via a promo succeeding the first-season finale and an earlier statement by Viola Davis also confirming the renewal at the close of shooting for the first season. It would contain 15 episodes, like the previous season. Production began on May 21, 2015, with Shonda Rhimes announcing on Twitter that Peter Nowalk and his writers were in full swing mapping the second season.

26,Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous,United States,Universal Pictures DreamWorks Animation Television Amblin Entertainment,Netflix,,,23,"Science fiction,Action-adventure",2,16,"Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous is an American animated science fiction action-adventure streaming television series developed by Zack Stentz. Based on the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, the series debuted on Netflix on September 18, 2020, as part of the Jurassic Park franchise, and is set before, during, and after the events of the film Jurassic World. It stars Paul-Mikél Williams, Sean Giambrone, Kausar Mohammed, Jenna Ortega, Ryan Potter, and Raini Rodriguez as six teenagers who become stranded on Isla Nublar after multiple dinosaurs escape their habitats. Jameela Jamil, Glen Powell, Stephanie Beatriz, Bradley Whitford, and Angus Sampson also star in recurring roles, and the series features music composed by Leo Birenberg.
Following its first season's release, the show was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics, who applauded the animation and diverse voice cast but criticized the show's character designs and writing. In October 2020, a second season was announced that premiered on January 22, 2021. In March, a ten-episode third season was teased that is scheduled to be released on May 21, 2021. Aaron Hammersley and Scott Kreamer both serve as showrunners for the series, executive-producing along Lane Lueras, Steven Spielberg, Colin Trevorrow, and Frank Marshall.",,"Section: Production (1):
According to series developer and consulting producer Zack Stentz, production on Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous began as early as April 2017. In June 2018, Scott Kreamer took over a premise and pilot script written by Stentz and began to work on the show's early design. In 2019, it was announced that a CGI-animated series would debut on Netflix the following year, and that it would be set during the events of the 2015 film Jurassic World. A joint project between Netflix, Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and DreamWorks Animation, Scott Kreamer and Aaron Hammersley worked together as the series' showrunners, executive-producing the series along with Lane Lueras, Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, and Colin Trevorrow.Spielberg did not want the series to be a ""kiddy version"" of the Jurassic Park films, insisting that the young characters be placed in dangerous scenarios, as in the films. Kreamer and Hammersley joined the project after it was greenlit, and they shared Spielberg's vision. The three were inspired by various Spielberg films which often depicted children facing danger. Unlike the Jurassic Park films, in which children are secondary characters rescued by adults, the series instead focuses on the teenagers and their efforts to survive on their own. While working, crew members watched the film Jurassic World several times to develop tie-ins between the film and the show, even creating a map of Isla Nublar to help with the process.

According to staff writer Sheela Shrinivas and story editor Josie Campbell, the hardest characters to develop for the show were Yaz and Brooklynn, as the writers struggled to find ways to make the characters ""likable"" to viewers. However, they ultimately decided that the best thing to do would be to bring out the character's weaknesses, in an attempt to have viewers sympathize with each character. Additionally, the role of Dave was written specifically for Glen Powell, which he said made voicing the character ""easy and fun"".While executive producing, Trevorrow said he had two rules he told the show's crew: to treat the dinosaurs as actual animals when creating a story, and to avoid animating aerial shots to keep scenes ""grounded"". Programs such as V-Ray, Autodesk Maya, and Nuke were used to create the series. The COVID-19 pandemic began during production, and the series crew had to work from home as a result.The series also features original music composed by Leo Birenberg, using themes from the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World soundtracks, composed by John Williams and Michael Giacchino respectively. In an interview, Birenberg said that he first heard of the show from music executives Alex Nixon and Frank Garcia, who he had previously worked with on Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, after being recommended by Giacchino, who he had already met.On October 9, 2020, Netflix announced that the series would be returning for a second season, production of which had already been completed at that time, and which was released on January 22, 2021. Early drafts for the season considered having the character of Ben die shortly after his fall in the first season's finale, but these plans were abandoned and Ben survived to continue appearing in the series. That same day in October, Colin Trevorrow attended a virtual panel at the 2020 New York Comic Con, in which he stated that the show's second season gave the production crew ""a lot of freedom"", as the first season depended entirely on the context found in Jurassic World, and the second season was set six months prior to opening sequence in Fallen Kingdom.In an interview, Trevorrow told Comic Book Resources that the appearance of animal trafficking in Fallen Kingdom encouraged the writers of Camp Cretaceous to feature big-game hunting as a major plot point of the show's second season, in an attempt to teach children that these problems still existed. When asked about the future of the series, Trevorrow told Screen Rant that the crew at Camp Cretaceous had a story already planned out that ""will take these kids deeper into a journey that pulls further and further away from Jurassic World."" On March 11, 2021, a ten-episode third season was announced with a release date set for later that year on May 21.

Jesse Hassenger from The A.V. Club gave the season a grade rating of a C+, calling the show unrealistic storywise, but also saying that its character development was ""clever"", stating that the show presented an accurate depiction of teenagers.

In a negative review, Empire journalist Ben Travis gave the season a rating of two stars out of five, criticizing the show's writing along with its characters, who he said were ""unlikeable"" and ""drawn in thin stereotypes and forced dialogue"", concluding that the first season was only meant for younger viewers. On the other side of the spectrum, Beth Elderkin of io9 found the season to be excessively violent, pointing out that ""not an episode goes by without at least one kid being put in mortal danger"". However, she noted the consistency throughout the season, stating that ""it's rare to find a modern children's show that trusts its audience to handle more intense subject material [...] even if it's unsettling at times."" Having watched the first episode, the crew at Decider hesitantly recommended viewers to stream the series.

Screen Rant journalist John Orquiola lauded the show's story, action, and characters, specifically in the episode titled ""The Watering Hole"", stating that it was similar to the ending of the original Jurassic Park, and a ""clever spin"" on the directing style of Steven Spielberg. Rafael Motamayor, writing for The New York Observer, also shared positive feedback to ""The Watering Hole"", stating that the episode was ""full of wonder"", and writing that it allowed the show to ""capture the feeling of the original Jurassic Park, while bringing the dinosaurs to the forefront of the story.""

Maggie Adan of Cosmopolitan Philippines wrote that she ""initially found the motivations of the characters a little irrational and [shallow] ... but afterlooking back on [her] teenage years and recalling that [she] was prone to blowing things out of proportion and being melodramatic about love and relationships at that age, too, [she] realised that the show is actually more truthful than [she] give it credit for ... it just doesn't resonate with [her] anymore"" Stephen McCarty from the South China Morning Post opined that ""Love Alarm is not only an innocent love story but also deals with data protection, gay rights, the extreme consequences of heartache, and smartphone invasion.""Cinema Escapist's Richard Yu commends Love Alarm for being a social commentary on the negative influence of social media in today's society. He posits:

...you’re probably thinking that Love Alarm is just a mediocre boilerplate high school drama—and on the surface, you’d be right. But once you peel back the layers of abstraction and inspect the story’s elements, you’ll find that Love Alarm is more like Black Mirror than High School Musical ... Love Alarm brings to light the dark side of social media: whether it’s self-esteem issues, or how social media makes our relationships more superficial ... While Love Alarm comes up short in plot, it shines in social commentary that’s increasingly necessary as we realize social media damages both our individual mental health and society’s collective mental health .... The series is a bit of a Trojan horse for unassuming teen audiences: they might be drawn in by the Cinderella-like love story, but end up learning a lesson about the ills of social media addiction.

The opening theme is a six-second clip from ""Being Evil Has a Price"", performed by the band Heavy Young Heathens. In a lawsuit filed against Warner Bros., the song's composers, Robert and Aron Marderosian, claim the song has been used without giving them proper credit or a licensing agreement.Several episodes include musical performances by Tom Ellis, although he has stated in interviews that while it is his vocals, the piano accompaniment seen on screen is not actually his. Neil Gaiman is a fan of David Bowie, and some of Bowie's music has been used on the series (The illustration of Lucifer in the comics is also based on David Bowie).Simultaneously with the release of the first half of Season 5, an official soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music, containing cast recordings from all five released seasons.

The pilot episode was screened in July at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con. The pilot was met positively by the viewers, with Bleeding Cool's Dan Wickline praising the episode, saying ""the show itself is enjoyable because of the great dialogue and flawless delivery from its lead"" and ""This version of Lucifer refuses to take almost anything seriously and the show is better for it.""
Max Nicholson of IGN rated the pilot episode a 6.9/10, praising Tom Ellis's performance as Lucifer and the lighthearted tone of the series, but criticizing the series for essentially being another crime procedural series.The first season received mainly negative reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of critics gave it a positive review based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 5.36/10. The site's critics consensus reads, ""Lucifer's got sex appeal, but the show's hackneyed cop procedural format undermines a potentially entertaining premise."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 49 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews.""Critics have been much more receptive to the rest of the series. The second season currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 7.83/10. The site's critics consensus reads, ""Tom Ellis continues to shine as the Morning Star, though perhaps he could fly higher if he weren't locked into such a familiar format.""Ed Power of The Telegraph gave the second-season premiere a 4/5, stating that ""It is entirely beguiled by its own preposterousness."" Bernard Boo of We Got This Covered gave the premiere 3.5/5 stars, saying ""Lucifer's second season gets off to a nice start, building on the show's strengths while retaining some of the weaknesses. It remains an unapologetically sordid, demonically fun hour of TV."" LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave it a B, calling the episode funny with ""genuinely funny moments to come from"" and saying that the premiere ""starts the season off on a good note.""

Section: Censorship campaign (2):
On May 28, 2015, the American Family Association (AFA) website One Million Moms launched a petition to prevent the series' airing. The petition stated that the series would ""glorify Satan as a caring, likable person in human flesh."" It launched the petition and 31,312 people had signed it by the series' premiere date. Posted the same date on the main AFA website, the petition garnered 134,331 signatures by the premiere date. In response to the petition, character creator Neil Gaiman commented on his Tumblr page: 

Ah. It seems like only yesterday (but it was 1991) that the ""Concerned Mothers of America"" announced that they were boycotting The Sandman because it contained lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and trans characters. It was Wanda that upset them most: the idea of a trans-woman in a comic book... They told us they were organizing a boycott of The Sandman, which they would only stop if we wrote to the American Family Association and promised to reform. I wonder if they noticed it didn't work last time, either..."" Regardless of the campaign, Fox renewed the series in April 2016 for a second season.

On May 11, 2018, following the series' initial cancellation, co-showrunner Joe Henderson indicated that the third-season finale would feature a ""huge cliffhanger"" that was meant to deter Fox from cancelling the series and encouraged fans to ""make noise"" with the hashtag #SaveLucifer. Fans, as well as the cast and crew, rallied on Twitter and #SaveLucifer soon became the #1 trending topic. A second hashtag, #PickUpLucifer, emerged as a trending topic as well. An online petition also began circulating aimed at renewing Lucifer for a fourth season on a new network. Warner Bros. Television subsequently began shopping the series around to premium cable and streaming services. On June 15, 2018, Netflix picked up the series for a fourth season.

Filming of the first five episodes was completed primarily in Paris, on various streets and at the Louvre, both inside and out.According to research by Condé Nast Traveler, other important locations included La Naumachie pond at Parc Monceau and Musée Nissim de Camondo on rue de Monceau; the latter stands in as the Pellegrini home and is open to the public. Other listed locations include Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour, a parking garage on Rue d'Abbeville, the Marché Biron flea market, the Jardin du Luxembourg, the Pont des Arts, L'Appartement Saint-Martin (near Porte Saint-Martin), and the Maison d'Arrêt de Bois-d'Arcy prison. 
The publication adds that parts of the fifth episode were filmed in the town of Étretat, which is located along the coast of Normandy. This location is significant because Maurice Leblanc, creator of the character Arsène Lupin, who was featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas, lived in the municipality. Some of the works were written at his residence there. The building is now the Clos Lupin Museum.The second set of five episodes were already filmed by the end of 2020 and are slated to be released in mid-2021.

30,Maradona in Mexico,Argentina United States Mexico,,Netflix,,,33,"Documentary,Comedy,Drama",1,7,"Maradona in Mexico is a 2019 documentary web television series directed by Angus Macqueen and starring Diego Armando Maradona, Gilli Messer and Jarrod Pistilli. The premise is set in 2018-19 and revolves around the Argentinian soccer player Diego Maradona’s coaching of Mexico’s second division club Dorados de Sinaloa in Culiacán.",,,"Diego Maradona tears a piece of paper, then again, until it is in shreds. On a screen opposite, the team he manages are minutes from victory in the first leg of a final tie – yet his stare is within. Maradona has been sent off for arguing with the fourth official, needlessly but because he cares – passionately.“I told him there was an elbow to the head,” he reflects aloud. “The San Luís trainer told me to shut my mouth. I said: ‘Really? Do you know how many games I’ve played?’ I’m not perfect. No one’s perfect. Sometimes I’m confronted by things I can’t control. But be clear: I’m a good man. I want to improve football, for the good of people.This is the opening scene to a seven-part series, Maradona in Mexico, launched on Netflix this week, following Diego’s year as manager of Dorados de Sinaloa of the Mexican second division. The team is based in Culiacán, fortress of the Sinaloa cartel of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, jailed in the US. A bizarre circumstance, given that which made Diego almost as infamous as his wizardry at football made him famous – cocaine.“It was too crazy to be true,” says the series director, Angus Macqueen. “Maradona, a coke addict, going to the world capital of cocaine.” But, as the club’s assistant press officer Oycé Leal says, welcoming Diego at a charity dinner: “When we heard Maradona was coming, everyone thought the obvious would happen, regarding the city’s reputation for organised crime, drug trafficking and Diego’s past history but he’s turned out to be completely different. He’s identified with a city that people thought would be the death of him. Culiacán is rescuing Maradona in an unimaginable way.” Just as he rescued the team, taking them from bottom of the league to an epic challenge for promotion.In his speech, Maradona responds: “They said I only came here for a holiday. No, I came to get us promoted. But my footballing commitment here is not only about the ball. It’s about people who are in need, who’ve also lost many things.” Diego found a home of sorts in Culiacán – not because of its cocaine industry but because of the resilience of people who live with its ravages.So the films are about football, but not; “about states of emotion”, Macqueen says, “in someone who expresses emotion with such clarity”. They are about Maradona but also a marvellous supporting cast of players, radio commentators and club officials, markedly the president, Antonio Nuñez, whose dream was to “make it that when you googled Culiacán, the Dorados would come above Chapo Guzmán”. For that to happen, he solicited Maradona, got him “and all that signifies”.And crucially: the cast of citizens in a city that only two weeks ago was locked down by units of cartel gunmen after the army seized Guzmán’s son Ovidio, before being outgunned and releasing him. Also a city of families at the funfair, teenagers in discos – and fans watching football.There’s been much noise around Asif Kapadia’s feature on Maradona, and there will be more if it is nominated for an Oscar. Kapadia scores the open goal of assembling a riveting video scrapbook but tells little about Maradona’s inner world, less about his time in Naples we didn’t know 27 years ago, or what happened since and damn-all about football: it’s like a film on Jimi Hendrix dying of drugs that ignores how he played the guitar.By contrast, these films explore real-life Diego: fervent, complex, charming, impassioned, sentimental and endearingly unhinged. For someone – which I am – who watched Maradona every other Sunday in Naples for two years, drop-jawed, it’s this footage from Mexico that achieves riveting insight, eyeball-to-eyeball.We observe not only Maradona’s magnetism and mania, his presence and resonance, but also occult insight into football itself. Kapadia is about how the mafia devoured Maradona the footballer – we know that; this is about how Maradona the manager ignored the mafia and forged a football team.There are priceless vignettes: Maradona’s likeness as a birthday cake, into which the players plunge his face; “you are my family,” he beams, covered in icing. During training he scores from the goalline, curving the ball; he can still do it, and is poignantly rapturous. But never more ecstatic than when watching a Boca Juniors victory on television. Diego confesses his dream is another chance to manage Argentina.Maradona rasps with the Buenos Aires barrio dialect he never lost, sadly smothered in an awful dubbed version – it’s essential to see that in the original Spanish, subtitled. He waddles through the series with a spare tyre around his waist; he walks visibly in pain, from arthritis [for which he gobbles painkillers and undergoes plentiful physio]. Yet he’s always dancing: with the players, a cumbia on the pitch with Ms Leal. [(Diego always wore his heart on his face, and his speech after defeat in the first final, kicking a drinks cooler, is histrionic catharsis: “I’m even angrier than you,” he rants and weeps. “They can celebrate. Next year I want to stay with you if you want to stay with me. I love you all and I’m grateful to all of you. You honoured the Dorados badge, proudly. You know what? This hurt me a lot. That’s all.”)During doldrums, when even the pitch becomes diseased, he is asked: “Do you see it as part of your job to keep Dorados on the front pages, given your reputation?” His reply: “If they don’t talk about Maradona, what are they going to talk about? They’ll talk about Trump, that rubber doll.”Maradona trains Dorados with tactical insight, raw emotion and body language. He takes a desperate side and turns them into serious competition. He insists on “rhythm”. “Don’t do it for Maradona,” he urges before a game in Tijuana. “Do it for football!” But of course they are, palpably, “doing it” for Diego, “knowing that they, in Mexico’s second division, have become part of the history of Maradona,” Macqueen says.Maradona is self-aware from the start. Before a game in episode one, he is asked: “What’s the hardest thing about being you?” His response is visceral: “The most difficult thing is having people around all the time. People surrounding me. Though when I was ill, when I had my problem with drugs, I felt like the loneliest man on earth.”Eleven months is enough time with Maradona to win trust and the confessional insights that come with it. In the penultimate episode there is confrontation with his failures, talking about his two daughters, Dalma and Giannina. “There’s one person who saved me from the drugs,” he says. “Giannina Leonora Maradona, my youngest. She’d grab the sheet and say: ‘Dad!’ But I was comatose. ‘Dad, Dalma played with you. I want to play with you too!’ I was in a coma. Even in the clinic, I was still thinking about drugs, and this tiny, dark skinned, beautiful thing, told me the right words: ‘Daddy, play with me like you played with Dalma.’”The comic graphic title sequences and deployment of Mexican corrido songs give the series a jaunty touch; “let’s not take this too seriously”, Macqueen says. But two serious rip-tides cut beneath the surface.One is about football as passe-partout, key to doors that would not otherwise open – and safe passage in dangerous places. We all know football starts conversations with taxi drivers and market-stall holders, wherever. But football has also saved my life on occasions, striking up the apposite conversation at gunpoint in war zones; football changes the subject, and people forget to kill you.More journalists are killed working in Mexico than in Syria but Macqueen and his long-time collaborator Guillermo Galdos can hang out with a camera in places where a journalist’s every step is watched, only because they’re making a film about football.Villa Juárez is a hotspot in Sinaloa’s deadly internecine turf wars, whence midfielder Pedro Rentería comes, taking Macqueen’s crew to watch boys kick about in the dust like he did, then a gunfight on his phone during which “the truck getting shot up was just over there by the red wall”. (He adds: “When they said [Maradona] was coming, we didn’t believe it. I identify with him; many of us are from a poor background like him.”)The other serious undercurrent concerns Mexico’s narco-war itself: the death toll of 306,000 since the president, Felipe Calderón, assailed the cartels in 2006 is three times that of, say, the war in Bosnia during the 1990s. Yet this new kind of 21st-century war rages in apparent peacetime in a wonderful and beguiling country where invariably warm-hearted people go to market, to mass – and to watch football.Usually, reports from places like Sinaloa are about the violence with “normal” life at the margins but these films are about an important slice of that normal life, “this time, with the war at the edges,” Macqueen says.It’s a Mexico I inhabit joyfully: how thrilling to find, in episodes one and three, two stadiums – at Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez – wherein I’ve watched games over just the past month while covering – but escaping – that war.The war is never far away. The films will suddenly cut from a football dressing room or player’s kitchen to another bloodied corpse behind another police cordon. (War seeps into the narrative: before the final, an Ultrà from the Dorados’ Esquadrón Aurinegro crew jokes: “Chapo Guzmán’ll escape just to watch the game!”)That’s the beauty of it: David Faitelson of ESPN concludes, in episode six: “Look what Maradona has done. What he’s shown us here in Mexico is that he’s a person who works and created a team that plays and competes just like he did.”And all this “in a city with a global reputation for conflict and narco-trafficking – that’s where Diego had to go to give life to a football team. Incredible. The city where they traffic the very substance that almost ended his life.”Promotion from Mexico’s second division to the top flight is decided in a “finalisima” between the winners of two finals, each played at the end of the season’s halves astride a Christmas break – called the Apertura and Clausura. During Maradona’s Apertura and Clausura in Culiacán, 2018-19, both finals were between his Dorados and San Luís Potosí. It is not for me to reveal the outcome of the crucial second final – the tension is at times unbearable, not only for the viewer, but Diego, who during one game leaves the stands to which he has been banished after the sending-off, unable to take the suspense.",7.2,975,Positive,0.602

In Time's review, the show was named ""the funniest new family comedy of the year"". It has also been compared to the 1970s series Soap because of the multiple-family aspect. Some have made comparisons to The Office and Parks and Recreation because of their mockumentary formats. BuddyTV named the show the second best show in 2009, saying, ""Every actor is fantastic, every family is interesting, and unlike many shows, there isn't a weak link"". Robert Canning of IGN gave the season an 8.9 calling it ""Great"" and saying ""Simply put, Modern Family was one of the best new comedies of the season."" He also praised the ensemble cast and the characters, calling them lovable. According to Metacritic, the first season was the best reviewed new broadcast television series.Modern Family drew criticism from the LGBT community for its portrayal of Cameron and Mitchell as not being physically affectionate with each other. The criticism spawned a Facebook campaign to demand that Mitchell and Cameron be allowed to kiss. In response to the controversy, producers released a statement that a season two episode would address Mitchell's discomfort with public displays of affection. Executive producer Levitan has said that it was unfortunate that the issue had arisen, since the show's writers had always planned on such a scene ""as part of the natural development of the show"". The episode ""The Kiss"" eventually aired with the kiss scene in the background, which drew praise from multiple critics.

Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the second season four out of four stars, saying ""Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts, or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations, from subtle wordplay to big-laugh slapstick to everything in between."" In a later review Bianco stated ""as good as it was in its first year, is even better in its second"", positively comparing the characters to the characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show, and Friends. During the second season, Adweek named the show one of the 100 Most Influential TV Shows (98th chronologically). Despite this, some critics were less favorable toward the season and described it as a sophomore slump. Eric Stonestreet's acting was widely praised throughout the first season,but criticized during season two for being too contrived and ""over-the-top""; Alan Sepinwall called Cameron Tucker a ""whiny, overly-sensitive diva"". On the other hand, the praise for Ty Burrell's performance (as Phil Dunphy) continued.

The third season was met with critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, season three has a rating of 92% based on 13 reviews, with an average score of 8.33/10 and the consensus: ""Modern Family settles into a well-oiled groove, consistently delivering inspired farce and making it look effortless"". Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was ""the type of wacky-location stunt that's usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom"", the following episodes ""have been better [...] but they're still uneven"". He also criticized the writers for relying too much on ""stunt episodes and celebrity cameos, like David Cross"". He ultimately gave the season 3 out of 4 stars. James Parker of The Atlantic said, at the beginning of the third season that ""Modern Family is very, very funny, almost ruthlessly so ... [It's] a bit of a master class in pace and brevity ... The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik: hectically compressed but dramatically elegant, prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction."" He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that do not use a laugh track. During the third season, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance. ""A decade ago"", he writes, ""[gays] would have balked—and balked loudly—at how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp-wristed, high-voiced caricature."" But now, ""most gay people trust that the television audience knows we're a diverse tribe, not easily pigeonholed ... Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality. It's an odd kind of progress. But it's progress nonetheless.""

The fourth season of Modern Family received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes currently gives the season an approval rating of 73% based on 11 reviews, with an average score of 7.75/10 and the consensus: ""Modern Family still has charm to burn and boasts a uniformly excellent cast, but the series' subversive edge has dulled"". Halfway through the season, Rachel Stein of Television Without Pity wrote, ""much as I liked the pairings and some of the dialogue, [""New Year's Eve""] is just another contrived episode of Modern Family we can cite when we talk later about how a different show should have won the 2013 Emmy for Best Comedy."" Dalene Rovenstein of Paste Magazine gave the season a positive review, but said a better season was possible.

Section: Season 5 (3):
The fifth season of Modern Family also received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, season five has a rating of 90% based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 7.57/10 and the consensus: ""Modern Family returns to its conventional roots with grace in a fifth season that delights in providing reliable laughs and rekindles the show's trademark warmth"". Reviewing the season's first eight episodes, Matthew Wolfson of Slant Magazine wrote that the show ""appear[ed] to have finally arrived at the depressing and predictable low point toward which it [had] been trending for the past two years."" He also went on to say that the show had ""turned into a shrill pastiche of stereotypical characterizations and superficial banter lacking both feeling and wit"", assigning it a rating of 1.5/4 stars. Different writers for The A.V. Club rated, in total, a majority of the former-half episodes with a ""B-"" grade or less. One writer for the magazine, Joshua Alston, gave ""ClosetCon '13"" a ""C+"" and remarked that ""Modern Family becomes a high-wire act when it separates its characters into three storylines with no overlap between them."" The second half was more warmly received, with three episodes rated an ""A-"" or higher.

Section: Later seasons (3):
The series was renewed for seasons 9 and 10 in May 2017.Seasons 8 and 9 received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with main criticisms directed at the lack of character development, overstuffing of episodes, and too many filler episodes per season. While the show continued to be praised for its charm, witty writing, and the cast's performances, criticism grew in these seasons, particularly from reviewers such as The A.V. Club.
In January 2018, Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd announced that season 10 would most likely be the final season, during the Television Critics Association's winter press tour. However, in August 2018, reports indicated that ABC was in discussions to renew the series for a potential eleventh season.Season 10 received positive reviews from critics, citing the season as a significant improvement over the last two. The series was praised for its tackling of Haley's pregnancy, the humor of Mitch and Cam looking after Cal, and its dealing with change in a positive way. Episodes 'Torn Between Two Lovers', 'Good Grief, and 'A Year Of Birthdays' were particularly praised.
The series was renewed for an eleventh season on January 7, 2019, which was confirmed as the final season on February 5. The last season premiered on September 25, 2019, and aired its last episode on April 8, 2020.Season 11 similarly received mainly positive reviews. The season was praised for its themes of change and ending, and the improved humor upon the last seasons, with particular attention to episodes 'The Prescott', 'Legacy,' 'Spuds' and 'Finale.'
Modern Family's final episode, Finale, aired April 8, 2020, and received a B+ grade from Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club, citing 'there's something that's satisfying in just how low-key it is. The finale doesn't necessarily shoot for outsized emotions. Instead, it makes things personal. It's a finale that suits Modern Family as it is in 2020, a show that's settled into old age. This is a finale that's both tidy and unfinished, and that feels just right'. The episode was praised by critics and fans alike, particularly for the humor in Claire and Mitchell's ice skating scene, Mitchell and Cam's karaoke scene, and The Dunphy children's final joke on Luke, with TV Fanatic saying, 'one of the highlights of the episode were the scenes between Haley, Alex, and Luke.' Critics also praised Gloria finally letting Manny go, describing the scene as bringing the two characters’ arcs full circle. The episode's message of 'leaving a porch light on' was also praised, with fans and critics expressing this ending note's highly emotional nature.

Section: Criticism (2):
Michelle Haimoff of the Christian Science Monitor criticized the show for only casting the women as stay-at-home moms while the husbands have very successful careers: ""There is a difference between quirky, flawed characters and ones who are incapable of professional success. And when the latter is reliably female, it makes for sexist television. It also makes for unrealistic television."" Late Night with Jimmy Fallon writer Ali Waller asked her Twitter followers ""If Modern Family is so 'modern' then why don't any of the women have jobs?"" Other authors reinforce this criticism, claiming that stay-at-home mothers are no longer the norm in today's society. In season 4 of the show, the character Claire Dunphy reveals that she had been trying to find work now that her three kids didn't need a stay-at-home mother as much anymore, but that she found it tough to reenter the job market after such a long hiatus, despite her holding a college degree. In season 5, Claire returns to work a job at her father Jay Pritchett's closet company.
According to a CNET staffer commenting on a first-season episode: ""The wife and daughter are unable to learn how to use the remote and must be taught by the father, while the son is 'good with electronics,' even though he is thought of as the stupidest member of the family."" Arianna Reiche from Gawker commented on the episode ""Game Changer"" where Gloria hides her skill at chess so her husband will not be upset at losing: ""This moment is at best a sappy quip about compromise in an often heavy-handed series, and at worst, it's a moment in a show with 9.3 million viewers, on a network owned by Disney, which explicitly validates girls and women subduing their intellect."" The show eventually focused more on Claire's career progress, with her running for city council, flipping a home, getting a job in the fifth season, and finally taking over as CEO of Jay's company.

The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó), and having a strong Spanish identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.
The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de papel: El Fenómeno). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part. The series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 and 4 were also filmed in Panama, Thailand, and Italy (Florence).
The series received several awards including Best Drama Series at the 46th International Emmy Awards, as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song ""Bella ciao,"" which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English-language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix, with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American world.","Section: Cast and characters (1):

Subsections (5):
Section: Conception and writing (2):
The series was conceived by screenwriter Álex Pina and director Jesús Colmenar during their years of collaboration since 2008. After finishing their work on the Spanish prison drama Locked Up (Vis a vis), they left Globomedia to set up their own production company, named Vancouver Media, in 2016. For their first project, they considered either filming a comedy or developing a heist story for television, with the latter having never been attempted before on Spanish television. Along with former Locked Up colleagues, they developed Money Heist as a passion project to try new things without outside interference. Pina was firm about making it a limited series, feeling that dilution had become a problem for his previous productions.Initially entitled Los Desahuciados (The Evicted) in the conception phase, the series was developed to subvert heist conventions and combine elements of the action genre, thrillers and surrealism, while still being credible. Pina saw an advantage over typical heist films in that character development could span a considerably longer narrative arc. Characters were to be shown from multiple sides to break the viewers' preconceptions of villainy and retain their interest throughout the show. Key aspects of the planned storyline were written down at the beginning, while the finer story beats were developed incrementally to not overwhelm the writers. Writer Javier Gómez Santander compared the writing process to the Professor's way of thinking, ""going around, writing down options, consulting engineers whom you cannot tell why you ask them that,"" but noted that fiction allowed the police to be written dumber when necessary.The beginning of filming was set for January 2017, allowing for five months of pre-production. The narrative was split into two parts for financial considerations. The robbers' city-based code names, which Spanish newspaper ABC compared to the colour-based code names in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 heist film Reservoir Dogs, were chosen at random in the first part, although places with high viewership resonance were also taken into account for the new robbers' code names in part 3. The first five lines of the pilot script took a month to write, as the writers were unable to make the Professor or Moscow work as narrator. Tokyo as an unreliable narrator, flashbacks and time-jumps increased the narrative complexity, but also made the story more fluid for the audience. The pilot episode required over 50 script versions until the producers were satisfied. Later scripts would be finished once per week to keep up with filming.

Section: Casting (2):
Casting took place late in 2016, spanning more than two months. The characters were not fully fleshed out at the beginning of this process, and took shape based on the actors' performances. Casting directors Eva Leira and Yolanda Serrano were looking for actors with the ability to play empathetic robbers with believable love and family connections. Antena 3 announced the ensemble cast in March 2017 and released audition excerpts of most cast actors in the series' aftershow Tercer Grado and on their website.The Professor was designed as a charismatic yet shy villain who could convince the robbers to follow him and make the audience sympathetic to the robbers' resistance against the powerful banks. However, developing the Professor's role proved difficult, as the character did not follow archetypal conventions and the producers were uncertain about his degree of brilliance. While the producers found his Salva personality early on, they were originally looking for a 50-year-old Harvard professor type with the looks of Spanish actor José Coronado. The role was proposed to Javier Gutiérrez, but he was already committed to starring in the film Campeones. Meanwhile, the casting directors advocated for Álvaro Morte, whom they knew from their collaboration on the long-running Spanish soap opera El secreto de Puente Viejo, even though his prime time television experience was limited at that point. Going through the full casting process and approaching the role through external analysis rather than personal experience, Morte described the professor as ""a tremendous box of surprises"" that ""end up shaping this character because he never ceases to generate uncertainty,"" making it unclear for the audience if the character is good or bad. The producers also found that his appearance of a primary school teacher gave the character more credibility.Pedro Alonso was cast to play Berlin, whom La Voz de Galicia would later characterize as a ""cold, hypnotic, sophisticated and disturbing character, an inveterate macho with serious empathy problems, a white-collar thief who despises his colleagues and considers them inferior."" The actor's portrayal of the character was inspired by chance encounter Alonso had the day before receiving his audition script, with ""an intelligent person"" who was ""provocative or even manipulative"" to him. Alonso saw high observation skills and an unusual understanding of his surroundings in Berlin, resulting in unconventional and unpredictable character behaviour. Similarities between Berlin and Najwa Nimri's character Zulema in Pina's TV series Locked Up were unintentional. The family connection between the Professor and Berlin were not in the original script but was built into the characters' backstory at the end of part 1 after Morte and Alonso had repeatedly proposed to do so.The producers found the protagonist and narrator, Tokyo, among the hardest characters to develop, as they were originally looking for an older actress to play the character who had nothing to lose before meeting the Professor. Úrsula Corberó eventually landed the role for bringing a playful energy to the table; her voice was heavily factored in during casting, as she was the first voice the audience hears in the show. Jaime Lorente developed Denver's hallmark laughter during the casting process. Two cast actors had appeared in previous TV series by Álex Pina: Paco Tous (Moscow) had starred in the 2005 TV series Los hombres de Paco, and Alba Flores (Nairobi) had starred in Locked Up. Flores was asked to play Nairobi without audition when Pina realised late in the conception phase that the show needed another female gang member. For the role opposite to the robbers, Itziar Ituño was cast to play Inspector Raquel Murillo, whom Ituño described as a ""strong and powerful woman in a world of men, but also sensitive in her private life"". She took inspiration from The Silence of the Lambs character Clarice Starling, an FBI student with a messy family life who develops sympathies for a criminal.The actors learned of the show's renewal by Netflix before the producers contacted them to return. In October 2018, Netflix announced the cast of part 3; the returning main cast included Pedro Alonso, raising speculation about his role in part 3. Among the new cast members were Argentine actor Rodrigo de la Serna, who saw a possible connection between his character's name and the Argentine football legend Martín Palermo, and Locked Up star Najwa Nimri. Cameo scenes of Brazilian football star, and fan of the series, Neymar, as a monk were filmed for part 3, but were excluded from the stream without repercussions to the narrative until judicial charges against him had been dropped in late August 2019. A small appearance by Spanish actress Belén Cuesta in two episodes of part 3 raised fan and media speculation about her role in part 4.

Section: Design (2):
The show's look and atmosphere were developed by creator Álex Pina, director Jesús Colmenar, and director of photography Migue Amoedo, according to La Vanguardia ""the most prolific television trio in recent years"". Abdón Alcañiz served as art director. Their collaboration projects usually take a primary colour as a basis; Money Heist had red as ""one of the distinguishing features of the series"" that stood over the gray sets. Blue, green and yellow were marked as a forbidden colour in production design. To achieve ""absolute film quality"", red tones were tested with different types of fabrics, textures and lighting. The iconography of the robbers' red jumpsuits mirrored the yellow prison dress code in Locked Up. For part 3, the Italian retail clothing company Diesel modified the red jumpsuits to better fit the body and launched a clothing line inspired by the series. Salvador Dalí was chosen as the robbers' mask design because of Dalí's recognisable visage that also serves as an iconic cultural reference to Spain; Don Quixote as an alternative mask design was discarded. This choice sparked criticism by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation for not requesting the necessary permissions.To make the plot more realistic, the producers requested and received advice from the national police and the Spanish Ministry of Interior. The robbers' banknotes were printed with permission of the Bank of Spain and had an increased size as an anti-counterfeit measure. The greater financial backing of Netflix for part 3 allowed for the build of over 50 sets across five basic filming locations world-wide. Preparing a remote and uninhabited island in Panama to represent a robber hide-out proved difficult, as it needed to be cleaned, secured and built on, and involved hours-long travelling with material transportation. The real Bank of Spain was unavailable for visiting and filming for security reasons, so the producers recreated the Bank on a two-level stage by their own imagining, taking inspiration from Spanish architecture of the Francisco Franco era. Publicly available information was used to make the Bank's main hall set similar to the real location. The other interior sets were inspired by different periods and artificially aged to accentuate the building's history. Bronze and granite sculptures and motifs from the Valle de los Caídos were recreated for the interior, and over 50 paintings were painted for the Bank to emulate the Ateneo de Madrid.

Section: Filming (2):
Parts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region from January until August 2017. The pilot episode was recorded in 26 days, while all other episodes had around 14 filming days. Production was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes with the robbers. The main storyline is set in the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior scenes were filmed at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters for its passing resemblance to the Mint, and on the roof of the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers, part of the Technical University of Madrid. The hunting estate where the robbers plan their coup was filmed at the Finca El Gasco farm estate in Torrelodones. Interior filming took place at the former Locked Up sets in Colmenar Viejo and at the Spanish national daily newspaper ABC in Torrejón de Ardoz for printing press scenes. As the show was designed as a limited series, all sets were destroyed once production of part 2 had finished.Parts 3 and 4 were also filmed back-to-back, with 21 to 23 filming days per episode. Netflix announced the start of filming on 25 October 2018, and filming of part 4 ended in August 2019. In 2018, Netflix had opened their first European production hub in Tres Cantos near Madrid for new and existing Netflix productions; main filming moved there onto a set three times the size of the set used for parts 1 and 2. The main storyline is set in the Bank of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior was filmed at the Ministry of Development complex Nuevos Ministerios. A scene where money is dropped from the sky was filmed at Callao Square. Ermita de San Frutos in Carrascal del Río served as the exterior of the Italian monastery where the robbers plan the heist. The motorhome scenes of the Professor and Lisbon were filmed at the deserted Las Salinas beaches in Almería to make the audience feel that the characters are safe from the police although their exact location is undisclosed at first. Underwater scenes inside the vault were filmed at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. The beginning of part 3 was also filmed in Thailand, on the Guna Yala islands in Panama, and in Florence, Italy, which helped to counter the claustrophobic feeling of the first two parts, but was also an expression of the plot's global repercussions.

Section: Music (2):
The series' theme song, ""My Life Is Going On,"" was composed by Manel Santisteban, who also served as composer on Locked Up. Santisteban approached Spanish singer, Cecilia Krull, to write and perform the lyrics, which are about having confidence in one's abilities and the future. The theme song is played behind a title sequence featuring paper models of major settings from the series. Krull's main source of inspiration was the character Tokyo in the first episode of the series, when the Professor offers her a way out of a desperate moment. The lyrics are in English as the language that came naturally to Krull at the time of writing.The Italian anti-fascist song ""Bella ciao"" plays multiple times throughout the series and accompanies two emblematic key scenes: At the end of the first part the Professor and Berlin sing it in preparation for the heist, embracing themselves as resistance against the establishment, and in the second part it plays during the thieves' escape from the Mint, as a metaphor for freedom. Regarding the use of the song, Tokyo recounts in one of her narrations, ""The life of the Professor revolved around a single idea: Resistance. His grandfather, who had fought against the fascists in Italy, taught him the song, and he taught us."" The song was brought to the show by writer Javier Gómez Santander. He had listened to ""Bella ciao"" at home to cheer him up, as he had grown frustrated for not finding a suitable song for the middle of part 1. He was aware of the song's meaning and history and felt it represented positive values. ""Bella ciao"" became a summer hit in Europe in 2018, mostly due to the popularity of the series and not the song's grave themes.

It regularly trended on Twitter world-wide, largely because celebrities commented on it, such as football players Neymar and Marc Bartra, American singer Romeo Santos, and author Stephen King. While users flooded social networks with media of themselves wearing the robbers' outfit, the robbers' costumes were worn at the Rio Carnival, and Dalí icons were shown on huge banners in Saudi Arabia football stadiums. Real footage of these events would later be shown in part 3 as a tribute to the show's international success. The Musée Grévin in Paris added statues of the robbers to its wax museum in summer 2018. The show's iconography was used prominently by third parties for advertising, sports presentations, and in porn.There have also been negative responses to the influence of the show. In numerous incidents, real heist men wore the show's red costumes and Dalì masks in their attacks or copied the fictional robbers' infiltration plans. The robbers' costumes were banned at the 2019 Limassol Carnival Festival as a security measure as a result. The series was used in an attack on YouTube, when hackers removed the most-played song in the platform's history, ""Despacito"", and left an image of the show instead. In unrelated reports, a journalist from the Turkish state channel AkitTV and an Ankaran politician have both warned against the show for supposedly encouraging terrorism and being ""a dangerous symbol of rebellion"".Spanish newspaper El Mundo saw the public response as a reflection of the ""climate of global disenchantment"" where the robbers represent the ""perfect antiheroes"", and the New Statesman explained the show's resonance with international audiences as coming from the ""social and economic tensions it depicts, and because of the utopian escape it offers."" Viewer response was especially high in Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world, in particular Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, so Spanish as a common language did not appear to be a unifying reason for the show's success. Writer Javier Gómez Santander and actor Pedro Alonso (Berlin) rather argued that the Latin world used to feel at the periphery of global importance, but a new sentiment was coming that Spain could compete with the global players in terms of media production levels and give the rest of the world a voice.Netflix partnered with Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege for an in-game event, where hostages on the Bank map, wore Money Heist outfits. Outfits for 2 in-game characters were purchasable and the music in the background during the heist, was Bella Ciao.

Section: Critical reception (2):
The series' beginning on Antena 3 was received well by Spanish media. Nayín Costas of El Confidencial named the premiere a promising start that captivated viewers with ""adrenaline, well-dosed touches of humor and a lot of tension,"" but considered it a challenge to maintain the dramatic tension for the remainder of the series. While considering the pilot's voice-over narration unnecessary and the sound editing and dialogs lacking, Natalia Marcos of El País enjoyed the show's ensemble cast and the ambition, saying ""It is daring, brazen and entertaining, at least when it starts. Now we want more, which is not little."" Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, the musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension. At the end of the series' original run, Nayín Costas of El Confidencial commended the series for its ""high quality closure"" that may make the finale ""one of the best episodes of the Spanish season"", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to ""do something different, original, ambitious"", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's Locked Up.After the show's move to Netflix for its international release, Adrian Hennigan of the Israeli Haaretz said the series was ""more of a twisty thriller than soapy telenovela, driven by its ingenious plot, engaging characters, tense flash points, pulsating score and occasional moments of humor"", but taunted the English title ""Money Heist"" as bland. In a scathing review, Pauline Bock of the British magazine New Statesman questioned the global hype of the series, saying that it was ""full of plot holes, clichéd slow-motions, corny love stories and gratuitous sex scenes"", before continuing to add that ""the music is pompous, the voice-over irritating, and it's terribly edited"". John Doyle of The Globe and Mail praised parts 1 and 2 for the heist genre subversions; he also said that the series could be ""deliciously melodramatic at times"" with ""outrageous twists and much passion"" like a telenovela. Jennifer Keishin Armstrong of the BBC saw the series' true appeal in the interpersonal dramas emerging through the heist between ""the beautiful robbers, their beautiful hostages, and the beautiful authorities trying to negotiate with them."" David Hugendick of Die Zeit found the series ""sometimes a bit sentimental, a little cartoonesque,"" and the drama sometimes too telenovela-like, but ""all with a good sense for timing and spectacle.""Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave part 3 an approval rating of 100% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""An audacious plan told in a non-linear fashion keeps the third installment moving as Money Heist refocuses on the relations between its beloved characters."" While lauding the technical achievements, Javier Zurro of El Español described the third part as ""first-class entertainment"" that was unable to transcend its roots and lacked novelty. He felt unaffected by the internal drama between the characters and specifically, disliked Tokyo's narration for its hollowness. Alex Jiménez of Spanish newspaper ABC found part 3 mostly succeeding in its attempts to reinvent the show and stay fresh. Euan Ferguson of The Guardian recommended watching part 3, as ""it's still a glorious Peaky Blinders, just with tapas and subtitles,"" while Pere Solà Gimferrer of La Vanguardia found that the number of plot holes in part 3 could only be endured with constant suspension of disbelief. Though entertained, Alfonso Rivadeneyra García of Peruvian newspaper El Comercio said the show does ""what it does best: pretend to be the smartest boy in class when, in fact, it is only the most alive.""

",,,"Diego Maradona tears a piece of paper, then again, until it is in shreds. On a screen opposite, the team he manages are minutes from victory in the first leg of a final tie – yet his stare is within. Maradona has been sent off for arguing with the fourth official, needlessly but because he cares – passionately.“I told him there was an elbow to the head,” he reflects aloud. “The San Luís trainer told me to shut my mouth. I said: ‘Really? Do you know how many games I’ve played?’ I’m not perfect. No one’s perfect. Sometimes I’m confronted by things I can’t control. But be clear: I’m a good man. I want to improve football, for the good of people.This is the opening scene to a seven-part series, Maradona in Mexico, launched on Netflix this week, following Diego’s year as manager of Dorados de Sinaloa of the Mexican second division. The team is based in Culiacán, fortress of the Sinaloa cartel of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, jailed in the US. A bizarre circumstance, given that which made Diego almost as infamous as his wizardry at football made him famous – cocaine.“It was too crazy to be true,” says the series director, Angus Macqueen. “Maradona, a coke addict, going to the world capital of cocaine.” But, as the club’s assistant press officer Oycé Leal says, welcoming Diego at a charity dinner: “When we heard Maradona was coming, everyone thought the obvious would happen, regarding the city’s reputation for organised crime, drug trafficking and Diego’s past history but he’s turned out to be completely different. He’s identified with a city that people thought would be the death of him. Culiacán is rescuing Maradona in an unimaginable way.” Just as he rescued the team, taking them from bottom of the league to an epic challenge for promotion.In his speech, Maradona responds: “They said I only came here for a holiday. No, I came to get us promoted. But my footballing commitment here is not only about the ball. It’s about people who are in need, who’ve also lost many things.” Diego found a home of sorts in Culiacán – not because of its cocaine industry but because of the resilience of people who live with its ravages.So the films are about football, but not; “about states of emotion”, Macqueen says, “in someone who expresses emotion with such clarity”. They are about Maradona but also a marvellous supporting cast of players, radio commentators and club officials, markedly the president, Antonio Nuñez, whose dream was to “make it that when you googled Culiacán, the Dorados would come above Chapo Guzmán”. For that to happen, he solicited Maradona, got him “and all that signifies”.And crucially: the cast of citizens in a city that only two weeks ago was locked down by units of cartel gunmen after the army seized Guzmán’s son Ovidio, before being outgunned and releasing him. Also a city of families at the funfair, teenagers in discos – and fans watching football.There’s been much noise around Asif Kapadia’s feature on Maradona, and there will be more if it is nominated for an Oscar. Kapadia scores the open goal of assembling a riveting video scrapbook but tells little about Maradona’s inner world, less about his time in Naples we didn’t know 27 years ago, or what happened since and damn-all about football: it’s like a film on Jimi Hendrix dying of drugs that ignores how he played the guitar.By contrast, these films explore real-life Diego: fervent, complex, charming, impassioned, sentimental and endearingly unhinged. For someone – which I am – who watched Maradona every other Sunday in Naples for two years, drop-jawed, it’s this footage from Mexico that achieves riveting insight, eyeball-to-eyeball.We observe not only Maradona’s magnetism and mania, his presence and resonance, but also occult insight into football itself. Kapadia is about how the mafia devoured Maradona the footballer – we know that; this is about how Maradona the manager ignored the mafia and forged a football team.There are priceless vignettes: Maradona’s likeness as a birthday cake, into which the players plunge his face; “you are my family,” he beams, covered in icing. During training he scores from the goalline, curving the ball; he can still do it, and is poignantly rapturous. But never more ecstatic than when watching a Boca Juniors victory on television. Diego confesses his dream is another chance to manage Argentina.Maradona rasps with the Buenos Aires barrio dialect he never lost, sadly smothered in an awful dubbed version – it’s essential to see that in the original Spanish, subtitled. He waddles through the series with a spare tyre around his waist; he walks visibly in pain, from arthritis [for which he gobbles painkillers and undergoes plentiful physio]. Yet he’s always dancing: with the players, a cumbia on the pitch with Ms Leal. [(Diego always wore his heart on his face, and his speech after defeat in the first final, kicking a drinks cooler, is histrionic catharsis: “I’m even angrier than you,” he rants and weeps. “They can celebrate. Next year I want to stay with you if you want to stay with me. I love you all and I’m grateful to all of you. You honoured the Dorados badge, proudly. You know what? This hurt me a lot. That’s all.”)During doldrums, when even the pitch becomes diseased, he is asked: “Do you see it as part of your job to keep Dorados on the front pages, given your reputation?” His reply: “If they don’t talk about Maradona, what are they going to talk about? They’ll talk about Trump, that rubber doll.”Maradona trains Dorados with tactical insight, raw emotion and body language. He takes a desperate side and turns them into serious competition. He insists on “rhythm”. “Don’t do it for Maradona,” he urges before a game in Tijuana. “Do it for football!” But of course they are, palpably, “doing it” for Diego, “knowing that they, in Mexico’s second division, have become part of the history of Maradona,” Macqueen says.Maradona is self-aware from the start. Before a game in episode one, he is asked: “What’s the hardest thing about being you?” His response is visceral: “The most difficult thing is having people around all the time. People surrounding me. Though when I was ill, when I had my problem with drugs, I felt like the loneliest man on earth.”Eleven months is enough time with Maradona to win trust and the confessional insights that come with it. In the penultimate episode there is confrontation with his failures, talking about his two daughters, Dalma and Giannina. “There’s one person who saved me from the drugs,” he says. “Giannina Leonora Maradona, my youngest. She’d grab the sheet and say: ‘Dad!’ But I was comatose. ‘Dad, Dalma played with you. I want to play with you too!’ I was in a coma. Even in the clinic, I was still thinking about drugs, and this tiny, dark skinned, beautiful thing, told me the right words: ‘Daddy, play with me like you played with Dalma.’”The comic graphic title sequences and deployment of Mexican corrido songs give the series a jaunty touch; “let’s not take this too seriously”, Macqueen says. But two serious rip-tides cut beneath the surface.One is about football as passe-partout, key to doors that would not otherwise open – and safe passage in dangerous places. We all know football starts conversations with taxi drivers and market-stall holders, wherever. But football has also saved my life on occasions, striking up the apposite conversation at gunpoint in war zones; football changes the subject, and people forget to kill you.More journalists are killed working in Mexico than in Syria but Macqueen and his long-time collaborator Guillermo Galdos can hang out with a camera in places where a journalist’s every step is watched, only because they’re making a film about football.Villa Juárez is a hotspot in Sinaloa’s deadly internecine turf wars, whence midfielder Pedro Rentería comes, taking Macqueen’s crew to watch boys kick about in the dust like he did, then a gunfight on his phone during which “the truck getting shot up was just over there by the red wall”. (He adds: “When they said [Maradona] was coming, we didn’t believe it. I identify with him; many of us are from a poor background like him.”)The other serious undercurrent concerns Mexico’s narco-war itself: the death toll of 306,000 since the president, Felipe Calderón, assailed the cartels in 2006 is three times that of, say, the war in Bosnia during the 1990s. Yet this new kind of 21st-century war rages in apparent peacetime in a wonderful and beguiling country where invariably warm-hearted people go to market, to mass – and to watch football.Usually, reports from places like Sinaloa are about the violence with “normal” life at the margins but these films are about an important slice of that normal life, “this time, with the war at the edges,” Macqueen says.It’s a Mexico I inhabit joyfully: how thrilling to find, in episodes one and three, two stadiums – at Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez – wherein I’ve watched games over just the past month while covering – but escaping – that war.The war is never far away. The films will suddenly cut from a football dressing room or player’s kitchen to another bloodied corpse behind another police cordon. (War seeps into the narrative: before the final, an Ultrà from the Dorados’ Esquadrón Aurinegro crew jokes: “Chapo Guzmán’ll escape just to watch the game!”)That’s the beauty of it: David Faitelson of ESPN concludes, in episode six: “Look what Maradona has done. What he’s shown us here in Mexico is that he’s a person who works and created a team that plays and competes just like he did.”And all this “in a city with a global reputation for conflict and narco-trafficking – that’s where Diego had to go to give life to a football team. Incredible. The city where they traffic the very substance that almost ended his life.”Promotion from Mexico’s second division to the top flight is decided in a “finalisima” between the winners of two finals, each played at the end of the season’s halves astride a Christmas break – called the Apertura and Clausura. During Maradona’s Apertura and Clausura in Culiacán, 2018-19, both finals were between his Dorados and San Luís Potosí. It is not for me to reveal the outcome of the crucial second final – the tension is at times unbearable, not only for the viewer, but Diego, who during one game leaves the stands to which he has been banished after the sending-off, unable to take the suspense.",8.5,37486,Positive,0.602

On Metacritic, the series has a  weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".Michael Starr of the New York Post wrote: ""New Amsterdam will satisfy fans of the genre. It’s somewhat predictable, with a moderate dose of prime-time soapiness. But with Eggold’s strong performance and an interesting supporting cast, this show could be the right prescription to attract a following.""
Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times wrote: ""It is as baldly manipulative and corny as heck--the pilot ends with a Coldplay song--and even a little ridiculous. But the actors sell it, and the fact that the action can seem so unlikely oddly just makes it more compelling.""
Caroline Framke of Variety gave the series a negative review, and was critical of Ryan Eggold in particular: ""The problem is that no matter how many side characters and plots the series adds into the mix--and it adds a lot--the doctor who’s supposed to be its main catalyst for change is so irritating that he ends up overshadowing the more promising elements.""

Even at his advanced age, Hopson is a sexually active deviant, who often recounts his sexual endeavors with other men. He is also senile, which leads to many comical misunderstandings.

In February 2013, The CW announced its order of a pilot for a TV series based on the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, created by Stephanie Sengupta and Laurie McCarthy, and produced by CBS Studios. Part of the reason McCarthy chose Mary Stuart as the subject is because of her life history and multiple husbands, which makes her story ""sexier"". The pilot was directed by Brad Silberling, with Sengupta and McCarthy as the writers and executive directors; Sengupta left the team in May 2013, leaving Laurie McCarthy as the sole showrunner. On February 9, 2013, it was announced that Australian actress Adelaide Kane would be playing the main character.In interviews preceding the premiere, showrunner McCarthy described the show as deliberately taking liberties with history, and that it's more ""entertainment"" than history, while actress Anna Popplewell referred to the show as ""fantasy history"", exploring the characters in hypothetical situations. Actress Megan Follows described the show as ""24 for the pre-Renaissance"", as the show tends to extend historical events over a longer period of time. McCarthy added that the show is designed to be interesting to a contemporary audience, so viewers who aren't familiar with history will be able to watch and relate to the characters. Among the creative choices is the use of modern music in the show soundtrack, and its costumes. The show's costumes are designed by Meredith Markworth-Pollack, who worked on the CW's other shows Hart of Dixie and Gossip Girl, who created different looks for Mary and her ladies, each to complement their differing personalities. The ladies: Lola, Kenna, Greer, and Aylee, are loosely based on Mary Beaton, Mary Seton, Mary Fleming, and Mary Livingston who were ladies-in-waiting to Mary, Queen of Scots.

Kane auditioned when she was filming a recurring role on the third season of MTV TV series Teen Wolf. When Kane got the part, the Teen Wolf writers wrote her character off the show. Kane is part Scottish on both her mother and father's sides, and is possibly a descendant of the real Mary, Queen of Scots through her mother. Kane did research on the historical Mary Stuart in preparing for the role. Toby Regbo was cast as Dauphin Francis before March 1, 2013, and British newcomer Celina Sinden was cast as Mary's lady-in-waiting Greer on that date. Torrance Coombs was announced as having been cast as Sebastian, one of the leading characters, in March 2013. Sebastian is an original character created for the show, so Coombs didn't have as much research in preparation for the role, though he faced the challenge of changing his performance from that in The Tudors, another historical TV series he'd been involved in. Alan Van Sprang, who was cast as Henry II of France, modeled his performance after Bill Clinton. In November 2013, Amy Brenneman was announced as having been cast as Mary Stuart's mother, Mary de Guise, a role that initially went to Brenneman's Private Practice co-star Kate Walsh, who was unable to commit due to conflicting filming commitments. On March 10, 2015, it was announced that Rachel Skarsten has been cast as Queen Elizabeth, a role that debuted in finale of season two and become a regular in season three. Showrunner McCarthy described the addition of Elizabeth as expanding the scope of the series, and that she would be part of season three's focus on the show's three queens.

Reign's lead costume designer is Meredith Markworth-Pollack. According to the Observer, Reign's custom blend of contemporary and historical fashion had mixed reviews from the show's audience. The show did not feature historically accurate clothing, however, was well-received amongst younger audience members—particularly young fashion bloggers—who found the aesthetics of the show's costume-line pleasing. In the same article, Meredith explains that there was a correspondence to the show's overall tone as seasons progressed. The costumes went from pretty, light fabrics befitting of young ladies to dark, more mature designs as Mary got older. Most of the costumes at the beginning of Reign's production were rentals found from different places in Europe, Los Angeles, and off-the-rack thrift stores. Once the show gained more traction, Meredith was receiving vintage fabrics to work with from all over the world.

Executive producer Brad Silberling knew someone who worked with the American folk rock band The Lumineers during the development period of ""Scotland"", the series opening theme song. In an interview about the song, the lead singer of the band, Wesley Schultz, commented, ""The song also was special to us because it had this beautiful driving rhythm that Jer [Jeremiah Fraites] played that reminded us of battle drums, like something out of Braveheart – hence the strange name – Scotland,"". Aside from the show's theme song which is aired for all four seasons, The Lumineers' have a second song called ""Charlie Boy"" which is also featured in the pilot of the first season.
In an exclusive interview with the show's music supervisor,  Madonna Wade Reed, she discusses how The Lumineers set the music tone of the show. Although the band did not create an original score for the show, Madonna explains that they used pre-existing songs throughout the show like the Vitamin String Quartet's cover of “Stubborn Love"" in order to maintain that connection.

Section: Editing for sexual content (2):
The show's pilot was distributed on May 20, 2013, to advertisers and critics for promotion and to generate hype. The pilot was edited before its final airing on October 13, trimming the sexual content of the scene where Kenna masturbates after witnessing a bedding ceremony. A later episode of the season, 1.13 ""The Consummation"", has two versions: an on-air cut for television broadcast, and an online streaming version with additional sexual content that was made available on the CW's website a few hours later. This action was criticized by the Parents Television Council for putting sexual content online ""where presumably children will be able to watch them with no rating or blocking capability"".

","Section: Reception (2):
Response to the show was mixed, with various critics highlighting the show's focus on romance and teenage drama instead of historical accuracy. A number of reviewers compared it to Gossip Girl, with similar emphasis on fashion, drama, and soap opera antics. The review of the pilot by The New York Times described Reign a strong candidate as a ""camp classic"", calling it fun and acknowledging its historical inaccuracies. The reviewer of The A.V. Club described the show as more ""an alternate-universe fanfiction than anything pretending to approach history"", calling the show camp and fun. The Miami Herald described the show's opening episodes as ""surprisingly entertaining"", with Adelaide Kane's portrayal of Mary as ""a teenager with a dawning realization that her royal caprices can have unexpectedly grim consequences offers an interesting take on the traditional coming-of-age story"". The review of Flavorwire described the show as ""fantastical princess wish-fulfilment"", a guilty pleasure that is relaxing to watch, and that its historical inaccuracy is to its advantage: ""There is something about abandoning all pretense of authenticity that gives this story a lightness it badly needs; dead-seriousness just isn't something that plays all that well at the moment."" Community Voices highlighted Reign as an interesting departure from The CW's other shows, but described it as stuck in a rut, making it difficult to sustain a show that's ""built on a binary premise: either Mary and Francis are coming together or they are drifting apart."" A review by a The Los Angeles Times critic was more critical, saying that the ""sexed-up version of high school with horses"" show ""does not deserve"" its main character, who is described as a ""The Princess Diaries knock-off"", but acknowledged that the show is self-aware of its position as a guilty pleasure. USA Today is also critical, describing the show as anachronistic and ""dumbing down"" history for the sake of entertainment.

Section: Development (2):
Warner Bros. began development on an Archie feature film in 2013, after a pitch from writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and director Jason Moore that would have placed Archie's gang into a teen comedy feature film in the John Hughes tradition. The duo brought the project to Warner Bros., where a VP recommended a more high-concept direction involving time travel or interdimensional portals, suggesting Louis C. K. to portray an older Archie. Dan Lin and Roy Lee became producers on the project, which eventually stalled as priorities shifted at the studio towards larger tentpole films, and was reimagined as a television series. The series Riverdale was originally in development at Fox, with the network landing the project in 2014 with a script deal plus penalty. However, Fox did not go forward with the project. In 2015, the show's development was moved to The CW, which officially ordered a pilot on January 29, 2016. On March 7, 2017, The CW announced that the series had been renewed for a second season. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a third season, which premiered October 10, 2018. On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a fourth season, that was originally planned to consist of 22 episodes.

Only 19 of the 22 ordered episodes of the fourth season were completed before the coronavirus pandemic. The fourth season premiered on October 9, 2019.""Chapter Forty-Nine: Fire Walk with Me"" was the first to be dedicated to Luke Perry, who died two days before the episode aired.On January 7, 2020, the series was renewed for a fifth season, which began a year later on January 20, 2021.On February 3, 2021, the series was renewed for a sixth season.

Section: Homages to other films and television shows (2):
Several reviewers have noted that the series' episode titles are often taken directly or slightly altered from the titles of older films. For example, De Elizabeth of Teen Vogue points out that Riverdale's pilot episode was named ""River's Edge"" after the 1986 film of the same name, and the season finale takes its name from 1997's The Sweet Hereafter. Executive producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa notes that this is a deliberate choice, in order to hint at what will happen in that episode. The episode ""Chapter Four: The Last Picture Show"" heavily features Rebel Without a Cause as well as other brief allusions to films including Candyman, American Graffiti, and Trog. References to the fictional setting of the Black Mirror episode ""San Junipero"" can be seen in season one as well as heard amongst dialogue in season two and three.Additionally, Katie-Kouise Smith, of Popbuzz, notes that the opening credits for Riverdale mirror those of the Twin Peaks television series, and are intended as an homage to that series' co-creator, David Lynch.

Section: Criticism (2):
Some reviewers have criticized the series for its handling of minority characters. While reviewing the first season, Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle declared ""the show marginalizes and ignores the [people of color] in the cast to the point where they may as well not be there."" In an article for Vulture, Angelica Jade Bastien discussed the show's treatment of Josie and the Pussycats (who are each played by African Americans), noting, ""They're not characters so much as they are a vehicle for a Message. Josie and her fellow pussycats are positioned to communicate the message that Riverdale is more modern and inclusive than teen dramas of the past, even though it has yet to prove it beyond its casting."" Monique Jones of Ebony noted, ""Despite the show's multi-racial casting choices, it seems like Riverdale is still a mostly white town."" She also expressed fondness for the relationship between Archie Andrews and Valerie Brown, but declared ""Archie shouldn't be what makes Valerie interesting to us"". Following the George Floyd protests, Vanessa Morgan criticized the show's writers on social media for underutilizing and sidelining minority characters within various storylines. Shortly after, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa responded in a tweet by promising to change and do better by these characters in future storylines.The show has also faced backlash from the asexual community for its deliberate decision not to portray Jughead Jones as asexual, despite the character being identified this way in some of the comics, and despite being urged by Jughead actor Cole Sprouse to represent the character's asexuality. Furthermore, the show has received additional criticism regarding the queerbaiting of certain characters.

I produttori esecutivi sono Nicola Allieta, Christine Reinhold e Andrea Romeo.
",,,"Netflix’s first Italian original doc series “SanPa: Sins of the Savior” follows controversial drug rehab founder Vincenzo Muccioli, and has made a splash on the platform since its Dec. 30 debut. In the last week, the series has cracked the platform’s top 10 most-watched programs in Italy, and currently holds the number 2 spot after “Bridgerton.”Directed by Cosima Spender — whose 2015 doc “Palio,” about the storied horse race held in Siena, went to Tribeca — “SanPa” is a deep dive into the complexities of Muccioli’s rise to national prominence, and the dubious methods used at his rehab center. As promotional materials put it, the charismatic Muccioli “cared for the addicted, earning him fierce public devotion — even as charges of violence began to mount.”Those charges included aiding and abetting the murder of one of his rehab’s residents, Roberto Maranzano, who in 1989 was beaten to death in a slaughterhouse within San Patrignano, the large therapeutic community that Muccioli founded in 1978 on a hilltop near Rimini, the central Italian city that, incidentally, was Federico Fellini’s birthplace. Muccioli, who died in 1995 before a definitive verdict could be reached, always maintained his innocence. “SanPa” is produced by a new Milan-based company simply called 42, and is being compared by Italian critics to other standout Netflix doc series such as “Wild Wild Country,” about controversial Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho), as well as “Making a Murderer.” It features a wealth of archive materials and, besides being directed by Spender, was crafted by a top notch production team comprising chief editor Valerio Bonelli (“Darkest Hour,” “Palio”), cinematographer Diego Romero Suarez-Llanos, who regularly works with Italian doc maker Roberto Minervini (“What You Gonna Do When The World’s on Fire”), and composer Eduardo Aram (“El Chapo”).The “SanPa” project is the brainchild of Italian journalist Gianluca Neri, who teamed up with Nicola Allieta — who, in a separate guise, is senior distribution manager at Copenhagen-based digital distributor Sweet Chili Entertainment — to bring the project to Netflix. Biografilm Festival founder Andrea Romeo and producer Christine Reinhold, who are all executive producers on the series, also came on board.Along with Italian Internet pioneer Marco Tosi, Neri and the others also formed 42. Now, the ambitious new company, segueing from “SanPa,” has several high-profile film and doc projects in advanced stages of development. Romeo early last year left 42 to become head of the doc unit at Italy’s Palomar, the outfit behind “Inspector Montalbano.”“The idea [behind 42] was to set up a company that could generate a type of product that does not yet exist in Italy,” Allieta told Variety. Neri added that they “want to tell big stories with top notch production values that can travel around the world.”Below are the standout projects currently in the 42 pipeline: ",7.8,1122,Positive,0.976

In a joint statement, the creators said: ""We wanted Sky Rojo to have the same frenetic action as always, but to use that 25-minute runtime to underline the dynamic nature of the plot: the getaway, the race for survival. The third act of a movie or an episode is where all the energy converges to produce the most vibrant explosion of all the conflicts that are being narrated. What we set out to do was to make a constant third act, to funnel our entire story through that frenzied energy"".On 19 January 2021, it was announced via a teaser trailer that the series' first season would premiere exactly two months later, on 19 March.

Multiple critics compared the series' cinematography with the films of Quentin Tarantino. Elizabeth Vincentelli of The New York Times described the series as ""sheer excess"" for its ""simultaneously minimal and over the top"" plot. Ellen E. Jones of The Guardian gave the series' first season four stars out of five and wrote: ""Sky Rojo's punchy 25-minute runtime is never long enough to truly try the patience. Those wild cliffhanger endings should have you slamming ""next episode"" faster than Coral slams the accelerator at a busy intersection"". NME's James McMahon gave the show three stars out of five and dubbed the show as ""cool"" and ""exciting"" one, highlighting its ""great music and solid performances"". Juan Sanguno from El País wrote that ""Sky Rojo turns every punch, every humiliation, and every threat into a triumph"".Sharing creators with Money Heist, it was only natural that Sky Rojo got compared to it. In her review, Keyla Cobb of Decider wrote that those who loved Money Heist will love Sky Rojo since ""both dramas look gorgeously slick, perfectly crumpling their on-the-run characters enough to look worn but still sexy"" while also singling out both shows' convergence in their ""dedication to humanity"". Cobb concluded that ""Sky Rojo feels like a successor to Money Heist"". The reviewer also compared the series to other TV shows like Good Girls, Big Sky and Fargo since they all revolve around ""panicked people who did something wrong and are now being chased by a nefarious force far more powerful than them"".Valerie Ettenhofer of Film School Rejects highlighted Sky Rojo's ""unique blend of dark humor, serious violence, and heightened drama"". However, she wrote that the show is ""neither as deep nor as clever as it thinks it is, but the thriller seems more concerned with being addictive than being perfect, and on that front, it succeeds"". She criticized Moisés and Christian's ""obnoxious amount of screen time"" since ""their frequent scenes are repetitive, unfocused, and not nearly as engaging as anything involving the women they're after"", ant that their scenes seem like mere ""attempts to humanize the villains"". Ultimately, Ettenhofer said that ""Sky Rojo's greatest strengths are its lead [actresses and actors]"". David Craig of Radio Times highlighted Verónica Sánchez's ""strong"" performance and gave the show four out of five stars. Craig wrote: ""on paper, Sky Rojo sounds as if it should be a rather bleak affair but, for the most part, the series avoids becoming too heavy by balancing its serious themes with a pulpy sense of humour"". Lali Espósito's performance was also singled out by many critics, with Trae Delellis of Miami New Times dubbing it as ""mesmerizing and affecting"".

While in development at TNT for over three years, the series faced numerous production issues and delays arising from creative differences between the series' producers and the network. The series remained in development hell until May 2019, when it was announced that the series would instead air on TNT's sister network TBS for a release in the second quarter of 2020 and that it had already been renewed for a second season. However, in September 2019, the decision to change networks was reversed.
Prior to studio shutdowns that occurred due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, most of the second season's production was completed. The second season premiered on January 25, 2021. In January 2021, ahead of the second season premiere, the series was renewed for a third season.","Section: Cast and characters (1):

Jennifer Connelly as Melanie Cavill: The powerful Head of Hospitality (the department responsible for smooth relations) and the Voice of the Train (responsible for making the PA system's daily announcements) aboard Snowpiercer. Though many of her peers are dismissive of the lower-class passengers, Melanie is curiously fascinated by them as she came from humble beginnings, explaining much of her sympathies. To the majority of the train, Melanie is believed to be Mr. Wilford's representative in relaying orders to the passengers and crew. It is later revealed Melanie has assumed his identity and is actually Snowpiercer's Head Engineer, working tirelessly to keep it functional. Melanie has been facing the crushing burden of directing Snowpiercer on its global journey, managing mounting resource and class issues, having her authority and decisions challenged and maintaining Wilford's iron order throughout the train to preserve the last of humanity. With few aware of her true identity, she is also desperate to maintain the myth of Wilford and keep her identity secret. Ultimately the secret is exposed, leading to a coup attempt by wealthy passengers from First Class, and a revolution by the Tail and Third Class sections with Melanie siding with Layton in the end. After the revolution, Melanie officially hands leadership of the train to Layton and resumes her duties as Head Engineer, but her plans to remain indefinitely in the engine room are threatened by the arrival of Mr. Wilford, and the surprise return of Melanie's believed-dead daughter Alexandra. In the second season, Melanie departs Snowpiercer to find a place that humanity can recolonize. In the second season finale, Layton and Alex discover that Melanie had sacrificed the last of her power to protect her data before walking into the Freeze to die, having ensured that humanity would have a future.
Daveed Diggs as Andre Layton: A former detective, is a quiet thinker who spends his days tending to his cage of rats in the Tail, and a dangerous rebel who helps coordinate and lead a revolution against the oppressive First Class to improve the harsh living conditions in the tail end of the train. As he is the world's only surviving homicide detective, he is reluctantly deputized by Melanie as Snowpiercer's Train Detective, to help solve a series of murders; involving him and those he cares about in a struggle that could upend life on the train. Layton uses his new position as train detective to investigate the killings, while gathering intelligence and support for the revolution, and uses what he learns to start a revolution by the Tail and Third Class sections. After a bloody conflict, Layton's revolution succeeds and he is officially handed leadership of the train by Melanie. Originally planning to implement a new democratic government, his plans are threatened by the arrival of Mr. Wilford. While at times Layton and Melanie have been enemies, only by putting aside their differences and working together did they save Snowpiercer and overthrow the system. At the end of the second season, Layton creates his own pirate train out of the first ten cars of Snowpiercer in order to resist Wilford, taking with him several of his and Melanie's most trusted loyalists.

Initially a friend to Melanie, she feels betrayed due to the recent revelations of the secrets Melanie was hiding from her and the rest of the train. After the revolution, Ruth is now Head of Hospitality, and is initially thrilled by Mr. Wilford's return, but begins to wonder whether Layton or Wilford is really the best thing for the train. When questioned by Layton, Ruth insists that her loyalty is to Snowpiercer and the passengers and Melanie believes that Ruth can be trusted as long as Layton remains honest with her.

After seeing Wilford's cruelty for herself, Ruth sides completely with Layton, but is inadvertently left behind with Wilford when Layton creates a separate pirate train.

She joins the crew of Layton's pirate train at the end of the second season.
Sam Otto as John ""Oz"" Osweiller: A young Brakeman and Bess' partner as a police-type figure of the train. He is more harsh and direct than Bess in dealing with passengers; however, his behavior could be from emotional trauma.

He was a British football player before the Freeze, raised by a single mother who was a prostitute and emotionally distant from him.

Initially believed to be the mysterious and reclusive Head Engineer of the train and is solely represented by Melanie, it is later revealed Melanie has assumed his identity and is the true Engineer; Wilford was believed to have died during the Freeze, after Melanie abandoned him to die at boarding, believing the remnants of humanity would not survive under his rule.

Section: Development (2):
In November 2015, Marty Adelstein's Tomorrow Studios optioned the rights to develop a television series based on the 2013 film Snowpiercer, which was adapted from the 1982 French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand, and Jean-Marc Rochette. The film's director Bong Joon-ho was attached as an executive producer alongside Adelstein and Josh Friedman, with the latter also set to write. A year later in November 2016, the project was ordered to pilot along with backup scripts by TNT with Friedman to serve as showrunner. In May 2017, it was announced that Scott Derrickson would direct the pilot written by Friedman. The pilot was picked up to series in January 2018. Later that month, Friedman was removed from the project by TNT due to ""creative differences"" with the network. Graeme Manson was appointed to replace Friedman as showrunner the following month. That June, Derrickson refused to return for reshoots on the pilot due to creative disputes with Manson, explaining via Twitter:

""The 72-page Snowpiercer TV pilot script by [Josh Friedman] is the best I’ve ever read. The feature-length pilot I made from that script may be my best work. The new showrunner has a radically different vision for the show. I am forgoing my option to direct the extreme reshoots.""
Less than two weeks later, James Hawes joined the series in July as a co-executive producer and a director to oversee the reshoots for the pilot. According to Manson, nearly nothing of the original pilot's footage was used outside of one special-effect scene, and this reshooting was the primary cause for the year-long delay in the show's premiere. Later that month, Netflix picked up the international distribution rights to stream the series outside of the United States and China. In May 2019, it was announced that the series would air on TBS instead of TNT for a spring 2020 release, and that a second season had already been ordered by the network. That month, it was also announced that Huanxi Media Group had signed on to broadcast the first two seasons exclusively in China. Manson will return as showrunner for the second season. In September 2019, the decision to change networks was reversed, with the series once again set to air on TNT. On January 19, 2021, ahead of the second season premiere, TNT renewed the series for a third season.

Section: Writing (2):
The series is designed to be a reboot of the original 2013 film's continuity. The story takes place seven years after a climate catastrophe rendered the outside world uninhabitable, forcing the remnants of humanity to live confined inside of a massive train that constantly circles the globe. The series investigates class struggle, as the passengers of the train are segregated by wealth. The series star Daveed Diggs said that the show would ""broaden exponentially"" the world established by the film and the 1982 graphic novel. ""That's one of the advantages of TV, you have time"" Diggs said, ""so the politics that are hinted at in the film are explored in much more depth and the mechanism of the train [is explored further] — just the little things that create a world, world specificity"". At the 2017 Television Critics Association press tour, TNT and TBS president Kevin Reilly revealed that the Snowpiercer series would be akin to a ""space ship show"" due to its contained setting and that it would feature a mystery during the first season.

In January 2017, it was reported that filming for the series was scheduled to begin in mid-March of that year. By September 25, pilot director Scott Derrickson indicated that production for the series had officially commenced. Reshoots for the pilot, overseen by new director James Hawes, began on August 20, 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia and concluded on January 24, 2019. Principal photography for the second season began on October 21, 2019 in Langley, British Columbia and was originally expected to end on March 20, 2020. In March 2020, production was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lena Hall, who portrays Miss Audrey, confirmed in July 2020 that the last block of episodes for season 2—episodes 9 and 10—were being filmed. As of March 11, 2021, filming for the third season is in progress until at least July.

Despite the series' roots as a graphic novel and film, production designer Barry Robison was told to give the train ""its own identity"". He conceived the massive locomotive on a ""very, very long piece of paper,"" drawing the entire train in ""about three days."" His Vancouver design team then set out to construct around 20 of the 1,001 cars of various sizes over four soundstages, heeding to TNT's orders to not make the train look ""too sci-fi"". Construction on each of the cars with contrasting classes took less than six weeks and was met with approval from series producer and film director Bong Joon-ho.

Launched in 2017, it is the seventh Star Trek series and was the first since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005. It begins a decade before Star Trek: The Original Series and follows the crew of the USS Discovery.
Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Michael Burnham, a science specialist on Discovery who eventually becomes captain. Doug Jones, Shazad Latif, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, Jason Isaacs, Wilson Cruz, Anson Mount, David Ajala, Rachael Ancheril, Blu del Barrio, and Ian Alexander also star. The series was announced in November 2015, with Fuller set as showrunner. He left due to creative differences with CBS and was replaced by Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, with producing support from Akiva Goldsman for the first season. Berg and Harberts were fired by CBS during the second, and Kurtzman took over as showrunner. He was joined by Michelle Paradise beginning with the third season, which moved the series more than 900 years into the future.
Star Trek: Discovery is produced by CBS Television Studios in association with Secret Hideout, Roddenberry Entertainment, and Living Dead Guy Productions. It is filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios in Toronto, Canada, as well as on location around the world. Designs from the Star Trek franchise were reinvented for the series to take advantage of modern techniques and visual effects. The series premiered on September 24, 2017, on CBS and CBS All Access. The rest of the 15-episode first season was streamed weekly on All Access, ending in February 2018. The 14-episode second season was released on All Access from January to April 2019, and the 13-episode third season ran from October 2020 to January 2021. The fourth season is set to premiere on Paramount+ in 2021.
The series' release led to record subscriptions for All Access, and positive reviews from critics who have highlighted Martin-Green's performance. It has received several accolades, including winning a Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award. The series began an expansion of the Star Trek franchise by CBS and Kurtzman, leading to multiple other series being produced. These include the companion series Star Trek: Short Treks and the spin-off series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.","Section: Cast and characters (1):
Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham: A science specialist on the USS Discovery who is promoted to captain at the end of the third season. Burnham is a human who was raised following Vulcan culture and traditions by Sarek. A non-captain protagonist was chosen to give the series a different perspective from previous Star Trek series, but the writers always knew that she would become captain eventually. Co-creator Bryan Fuller gave her a traditionally male name, which he had done with the female leads on three of his previous series.
Doug Jones as Saru: First officer of the USS Discovery who becomes captain for the third season. Saru is the first Kelpien to enter Starfleet. A new species created for Discovery, Kelpiens were hunted as prey on their home planet and thus evolved the ability to sense the coming of danger. Jones based Saru's walk on that of a supermodel, out of necessity due to the boots he had to wear to portray the character's hooved feet. The producers compared Saru to the characters Spock and Data from previous series.
Shazad Latif as Voq / Ash Tyler: Voq, an albino Klingon, undergoes extensive surgery to pose as the human Ash Tyler, who becomes chief of security for Discovery. Voq was credited as being portrayed by ""Javid Iqbal"", an invented actor named for Latif's father, to hide the connection between the characters. Latif described his character as ""complex and painful"", and noted that he has a relationship with Burnham. Voq's accent is Arabic-inspired, and Latif tried to maintain ""a kind of pharyngealness"" to Tyler's American accent. For the second season, Latif felt that he was playing a third character that melded Voq and Tyler, comparing this relationship to that of Bruce Banner and the Hulk in Marvel Comics.
Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets: Chief engineer aboard Discovery and a science officer specializing in astromycology (the study of fungi in space) whose research led to the development of Discovery's experimental organic propulsion system. The character is inspired by a real-life mycologist of the same name. He is the first openly gay character in a Star Trek series. Rapp acknowledged that Hikaru Sulu was portrayed as gay in the film Star Trek Beyond (2016), calling that ""a nice nod"", but said the series would actually explore Stamets and his partner ""in conversation, in our living quarters; you get to see our relationship over time, treated as any other relationship would be treated"".
Mary Wiseman as Sylvia Tilly: An ensign aboard Discovery. She works under Stamets and is Burnham's roommate. The character represents people at the bottom of the Starfleet hierarchy. Season one co-showrunner Aaron Harberts described her as optimistic and ""sort of the soul of our show.""
Jason Isaacs as Gabriel Lorca: Captain of the Discovery in the first season, a ""brilliant military tactician"". Isaacs described the character as ""probably more f-ked up than any of"" the previously seen Star Trek captains. He plays the character with a slight southern U.S. accent, and had initially wanted to ad-lib a catchphrase for the character, feeling that all Star Trek captains should have one, coming up with ""git'r done"" which the writers turned down due to it being widely used and trademarked by Larry the Cable Guy.
Wilson Cruz as Hugh Culber: Medical officer aboard Discovery and Stamets' husband. Cruz said portraying the first openly gay couple in Star Trek was ""a long time coming"" and praised the way the series did not go out of its way to focus on their relationship. The character is killed in the first season, but returns from the dead in the second season in a larger role.
Anson Mount as Christopher Pike: Captain of the Enterprise who takes temporary command of the Discovery in the second season. The character was first portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter in ""The Cage"". Mount described Pike as ""very by-the-book, usually, and a good person"", while executive producers Heather Kadin and Alex Kurtzman described him as being the opposite of Lorca with a ""very captain-like"" presence and ""enough confidence and authority to apologize when he is wrong"". Mount did not try to imitate Hunter's performance.
David Ajala as Cleveland ""Book"" Booker: A courier in the 32nd Century who works with Burnham.
Rachael Ancheril as Nhan: Former Enterprise crewmember who became security chief aboard Discovery. Nhan left in the third season during the 32nd Century.
Blu del Barrio as Adira Tal: The first human to bond with a Trill symbiont. They are also the first non-binary character in a Star Trek series.
Ian Alexander as Gray Tal: Adira's Trill boyfriend and previous host for the Tal symbiont until his death. He is the first transgender character in a Star Trek series.

On November 2, 2015, CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017, ""on the heels"" of the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Original Series in 2016. This was the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005, and the first show to be developed specifically for the CBS All Access streaming service. Alex Kurtzman, co-writer of the films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and Heather Kadin were set as executive producers on the series, which would not be related to the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond. The January 2017 date was the earliest that CBS could release a new Star Trek series after an agreement the company made when it split from Viacom in 2005. Showtime, Netflix, and Amazon Video all offered ""a lot of money"" for the rights to release the series, but after heavily investing in the new All Access service, CBS believed that a returning Star Trek could be ""the franchise that really puts All Access on the map"". In January, CBS president Glenn Geller said the CBS network were not creatively involved in the series, despite plans for the network to broadcast the pilot episode, saying, ""It really is for All Access.""

Section: Bryan Fuller (3):
After beginning his career writing for the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, Bryan Fuller was announced as the new series' showrunner and co-creator alongside Kurtzman in February 2016. Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), also joined the series as a consulting producer. In March, Rod Roddenberry (the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry) and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment also joined the series as executive producers. Fuller said that working with people previously involved with Star Trek was ""really about making sure that we maintain authenticity"", and said that Meyer—who is widely considered to have made the best Star Trek film in The Wrath of Khan—brings ""a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling.""Fuller had publicly called for Star Trek to return to television for years, particularly because of its impact on minority groups, as he explained, ""I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship. I couldn't stop thinking about how many Asian people were inspired by seeing George Takei and feeling that gave them hope for their place in the future. I wanted to be part of that representation for a new era."" When Fuller first met with CBS about the series, the company did not have a plan for what the new show would be. He proposed an anthology series, with each season being a standalone, serialized story set in a different era. This would begin with a prequel to The Original Series, followed by stories set during The Original Series, during Star Trek: The Next Generation, and then ""beyond to a time in Trek that's never been seen before"". Fuller compared this to what American Horror Story did for horror, and described the proposal as a platform for ""a universe of Trek shows"". CBS instead suggested he create a single serialized show to see how that performed first, and Fuller began further developing the concept of a prequel to The Original Series.Fuller announced in June 2016 that the first season would consist of 13 episodes, though he would prefer to produce 10 episodes a season moving forward. A month later, Fuller announced the series' title to be Star Trek: Discovery, and revealed that it would be set in the ""Prime Timeline"" (which includes the previous Star Trek series, but not the modern reboot films) to keep the concurrent series and films separate, so ""we don't have to track anything [happening in the films] and they don't have to track what we're doing"". Also in July, CBS Studios International licensed the series to Netflix for release outside the United States and Canada, a ""blockbuster"" deal that paid for the show's entire budget (around US$6–7 million per episode). During pre-production on the series, Fuller and CBS had further disagreements on the direction of the show. The production was starting to overrun its per-episode budget, and was falling behind schedule due to Fuller supervising all aspects of the series while also serving as showrunner on another new show, American Gods. This caused frustration among CBS executives who felt Fuller should be focused on having Discovery ready for release by the January 2017 premiere date.By August 2016, Fuller had hired Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, whom he had worked with on Pushing Daisies, to serve as co-showrunners with him. A month later, he and Kurtzman asked CBS to delay the series' release so they could meet the high expectations for it, and the studio pushed the series premiere back to May 2017."" At the end of October, CBS asked Fuller to step down as showrunner, and announced a restructuring of the production: Berg and Harberts were made sole showrunners, working from a broad story arc and overall mythology established by Fuller; Kurtzman and Fuller would continue as executive producers, but with Fuller moving his attention fully to American Gods; and Akiva Goldsman would join the series in a supporting producer role, similar to the role he held on Fringe alongside Kurtzman. CBS reiterated that they were ""extremely happy with [Fuller's] creative direction"" for the series, though some elements of the series that came directly from Fuller were dropped, including some designs and ""more heavily allegorical and complex story"" points. Fuller later confirmed that he was no longer involved with the series, but expressed interest in returning for future seasons if he was asked.

With production set to finally begin on the series in January 2017, ""a lot of careful deliberation [was] continuing to go into making Discovery special, from the choice of directors, to set design, to the special effects."" Ted Sullivan joined the series to serve as supervising writing producer. At CBS's 2017 upfront presentation, CBS Interactive president Marc DeBevoise confirmed a ""fall"" release date for the series, and announced that the episode order had been expanded to 15 episodes. In June, CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, with the season airing through November 2017, and then beginning again in January 2018. This break gave more time to complete post-production on the second half of the season. Also that month, Kurtzman said that he and Fuller had discussed future seasons before the latter's departure, and promised that ""what's there in terms of story and certainly in terms of set-up, character, big ideas, the big movement of the season, that's all stuff that Bryan and I talked about"" and would not be altered. Goldsman said in August that future seasons would have ""a hybridized [anthology] approach"" with ""arcs which will have characters that we know and characters that we don't know."" Kurtzman added that the success of Discovery could lead to other new Star Trek series that could potentially use the anthology format.By the end of August, Berg and Harberts had developed a ""road map"" for a second season and ""the beginnings of one"" for a third. It was also revealed that an average episode of the first season had ultimately cost US$8–8.5 million each, making it one of the most expensive television series ever created. This exceeded the original Netflix deal, but CBS still considered the series paid for due to the number of new All Access subscribers that it was expected to draw. After the series premiere, Kurtzman said the producers wanted to avoid announcing release dates for any future seasons, due to the external pressure that having to delay them caused with the first season. Despite this, he hoped a second season would be available in early 2019. The second season was officially ordered in October 2017, consisting of 13 episodes. Goldsman did not return for the season after clashing with the series writing staff during production on the first, while Meyer was not asked to return for the second season. In June 2018, when production on the second season was underway, CBS fired Berg and Harberts. This was due to the first episode of the season going significantly over budget, as well as alleged abusive behavior by the pair directed at the series' writing staff. Kurtzman was made sole showrunner and was set to ""regroup"" the writers without causing any delay to the season's production timeline.

Section: Alex Kurtzman and Michelle Paradise (3):
After Kurtzman took over, the second season was confirmed to be on track for a January 2019 premiere, though there ultimately was enough of a delay in production that CBS extended the season's episode count to 14 as a way to amortize the cost of the delays. Shortly after the season premiere, in February, the series was renewed for a third season with writer Michelle Paradise promoted to co-showrunner alongside Kurtzman. In October 2019, Kurtzman said the third season would consist of 13 episodes.Active development on a fourth season had begun by January 2020, and it was officially announced in October. Also in October, Kurtzman was asked how long he intended for Discovery to continue, especially with other streaming series being cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said ""there are years and years left on Discovery"", adding that the series' jump into the future with the third season had opened up new variables and storytelling opportunities that were preventing the series from feeling stale. He also noted the precedent of several previous Star Trek series running for seven seasons each, and later added that the series would remain in its new future setting for the rest of its run.

Section: Writing (2):
The series' writers room is based at Kurtzman's Secret Hideout offices in Santa Monica, and includes ""fans who all have very different relationships to Trek,"" which Kurtzman said is ""a healthy thing"". Fuller wanted to differentiate the series from the previous 700+ episodes of Star Trek by taking advantage of the streaming format of All Access and telling a single story arc across the entire first season. He and Kurtzman developed this story from the ""DNA"" of certain The Original Series episodes to find ""the spirit of what Star Trek offers, both in terms of high-concept science fiction storytelling and really wonderful metaphors for the human condition"". Berg said that the series' writers ""are so in love with"" The Original Series, The Next Generation, and the family aspect of those series, while Harberts added that Meyer's Star Trek films were an especial influence on Discovery because ""his storytelling is complex and intellectual and yet there's a lot of room for character voices"".The titular ship was named after Discovery One from 2001: A Space Odyssey, NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery, and ""the sense of discovery ... what [that] means to Star Trek audiences who have been promised a future by Gene Roddenberry where we come together as a planet and seek new worlds and new alien races to explore and understand and collaborate with"". Fuller saw the series as a bridge between Enterprise and The Original Series—which are set around 150 years apart—but set much closer to the latter to allow the series to ""play with all the iconography of those ships and those uniforms"". In May 2017, Sullivan described the series as ""a genuine prequel"" to The Original Series, with Goldsman later adding that there were many classic Star Trek elements that fans among the writers wished to include in the series, but couldn't because they were included in The Original Series as something being discovered by Starfleet for the first time then. The choice to feature a single serialized story throughout the first season was inspired by the general change in television to tell more realistic and serialized stories rather than the ""new destination-based adventure each week"" format mostly used in previous Star Trek series. Fuller had been one of several writers during the 1990s pushing for Deep Space Nine and Voyager to move towards this style. Also inspired by modern, ""peak television"" series such as Game of Thrones was a willingness to kill off major characters for dramatic reasons, though the writers wanted to avoid doing so gratuitously or for ""shock value"".Fuller said the series could ""push the content envelope since it won't be constrained by broadcast standards"", but ""it's still Star Trek. It will probably be slightly more graphic content ... I imagine we're going to shoot scenes a couple of ways and see what feels more authentic in the editing room."" Harberts ultimately described the series as a ""hard PG-13"", saying the series could include ""some violent things or [a] tiny bit of language"" but they still wanted the show to be for families and to ""honor what the franchise is."" On using time travel in the series, a plot device used in at least two episodes of every previous live-action Star Trek season, Fuller said that it had not yet been used for any episode by the end of August 2016, and, ""You never know when you want to pull out that device but I am not anticipating an over-reliance on time travel to tell this season's stories."" The series' writers also chose to ignore Gene Roddenberry's longstanding rule that Starfleet crew members not have any significant conflict with one another or be depicted negatively (a rule that Roddenberry himself did not always strictly follow). Harberts explained, ""We're trying to do stories that are complicated, with characters with strong points of view and strong passions. People have to make mistakes—mistakes are still going to be made in the future. We're still going to argue in the future ... the thing we're taking from Roddenberry is how we solve those conflicts."" Because of the show's position as a prequel to The Original Series, the producers felt it was more important for Discovery to build towards Roddenberry's ideals, and to show that ""you can't simply be accepting and tolerant without working for it, and so this show is about that struggle.""

Section: Casting (2):
By June 2016, Fuller had met with several actors, and said that ""we want to carry on what Star Trek does best, which is being progressive. So it's fascinating to look at all of these roles through a colorblind prism and a gender-blind prism"". A month later, Kadin clarified that the series would feature minority, female, and LGBTQ characters. In August, Fuller said the series would feature ""about seven"" lead characters, and unlike previous Star Trek series would star a lieutenant commander to be played by a non-white actress. He said the series would also include more alien characters than other Star Trek series, and would feature at least one openly gay character. Fuller, who is gay himself, had been determined to see this happen since receiving hate mail while working on Voyager when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as gay.By August, Fuller had discussed the series' casting with Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space who made a cameo appearance in an episode of The Next Generation. He anticipated casting announcements in October, but none had been made by the end of that month. The majority of the series main characters were believed to have been cast by then, but no actress had been cast for the series' lead role. This was a source of ""some internal stress"" at CBS. Several African American and Latina actresses were being looked at for the role, with CBS ""not seeking a huge star and [preferring] a fresh face for the part."" In October, the cast was believed to include ""a female admiral, a male Klingon captain, a male admiral, a male adviser and a British male doctor"", with one of those male leads played by an openly gay actor.In November 2016, Doug Jones and Anthony Rapp were revealed to be cast, as science officers Saru and Stamets, respectively. The former is a Kelpien, an alien race created for the series, while the latter is the first Star Trek character to be conceived and announced as gay. Sonequa Martin-Green was cast in the lead role in December, which was officially confirmed in April 2017, with the character's name revealed to be Michael Burnham. Also in December, Shazad Latif was cast as the Klingon Kol. In March 2017, Jason Isaacs was cast as Captain Lorca of the USS Discovery, and Mary Wiseman joined as Tilly, a cadet. At the end of April, Latif was revealed to have been recast in the role of Starfleet Lieutenant Tyler. In the series, this role is shown to be an undercover persona used by the Klingon Voq, who was initially credited as being portrayed by the invented actor Javid Iqbal to hide the fact that Latif was portraying both Voq and Tyler.Rapp revealed in July 2017 that Wilson Cruz, whom Rapp had previously worked with on the musical Rent, would portray Stamets' love interest Hugh Culber. The character is killed off during the first season, which was criticized by some as following the ""bury your gays"" trope. However, the executive producers of the series, Cruz, and GLAAD immediately released a statement saying ""death is not always final in the Star Trek universe"" and that the relationship between Culber and Stamets would continue to be explored. Harberts described it as one of the most important relationships in the series. Cruz was subsequently promoted from his recurring guest role to the series' main cast for the second season, in which Culber is brought back to life. After the first season concluded with the Discovery receiving a distress call from the USS Enterprise, specifically from Captain Christopher Pike, Harberts expressed interest in exploring that character; Anson Mount was cast in the role in April 2018, and stars for the second season.Casting had begun by June 2019 for the new role of Adira, a non-binary character described as ""incredibly intelligent and self-confident"" with the potential to become a recurring guest throughout the third season. The next month, David Ajala joined the cast as new series regular Cleveland ""Book"" Booker for the third season. Rachael Ancheril is also credited as starring for her appearances in the season, reprising her recurring guest role as Nhan from the second season. She is written out of the series in the third season's fifth episode. In September 2020, non-binary newcomer Blu del Barrio was revealed to be portraying Adira, while transgender actor Ian Alexander was announced as cast in another guest role for the third season, the Trill character Gray. Both Adira and Gray were noted as being the first explicitly non-binary and transgender characters within the Star Trek franchise, respectively. The two actors reprised their roles for the fourth season, and were promoted to the series' main cast.

Section: Design (2):
Mark Worthington and Todd Cherniawsky served as initial production designers for the series, with Tamara Deverell taking over during production on the first season; Gersha Phillips and Suttirat Anne Larlarb designed the costumes for the series; veteran Star Trek designer John Eaves designed starships with Scott Schneider; Glenn Hetrick and Neville Page of Alchemy Studios provided prosthetics and armor, with Page having previously designed for the ""Kelvin Timeline"" Star Trek films; and Mario Moreira served as prop master for the series. The series also employed seven art directors, over nine illustrators, more than thirty-five set designers, and over four hundred and fifty painters, carpenters, sculptors, model makers, welders, set dressers, and prop builders. The designers consult with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for scientific accuracy.Fuller said on the general approach to design on the show, ""we're producing the show in 2016. We have to update the style of the effects, the style of the sets, the style of the makeup ... all of the other series have been produced [at a time that] isn't as sophisticated as we are now with what we can do production-wise, we're going to be reestablishing an entire look for the series"" and for Star Trek moving forward. Fuller had wanted the series' uniforms to reflect the primary colors of The Original Series, but this was discarded after his departure. However, Fuller's designs for the Klingons, which he ""really, really wanted"" to redesign, were retained. 3D Systems' ""cutting edge"" 3D printing techniques were widely used in the making of the series. For the prosthetics, Page and Hetrick took detailed laser scans of the actors so they could simulate make-up and prosthetics in a virtual environment before creating the practical version. Fabric for the Starfleet uniforms seen in the series was custom-dyed in Switzerland; the costumes were cut and assembled in Toronto by Phillips and her department. The main uniforms seen in the series are a navy blue specifically mixed for the show, with gold or silver embellishments depending on the division of the officer. Medical officers wear a ""hospital white"" variant, also custom-dyed in Switzerland, while the captain's uniform is the standard navy blue but with additional gold piping on the shoulders. Starfleet insignia badges were molded from silicon bronze, and then polished and plated by a jeweler to create custom colors for the series, based on the division of the officer wearing the uniform: gold for command, silver for sciences and medical, and copper for operations. Props such as tricorders and hand scanners, communicators, and phasers were produced with 3D printing and heavily inspired by their designs in The Original Series.The design of the USS Discovery is based on an unused Ralph McQuarrie design for the USS Enterprise from the unproduced film Star Trek: Planet of the Titans, which Fuller had noted in July 2016 was ""to a point that we can't legally comment on it until [our legal team] figures out some things"". McQuarrie's designs were based on the concepts created by Ken Adam to feature a vessel with a flattened secondary hull. Fuller wanted ""something distinct about what our Star Trek was going to look like"", and after seeing McQuarrie's design ""saw sort of harder lines of a ship and started talking about race cars and Lamborghinis in the '70s and James Bond cars and started working on the designs, taking those inspirations and coming up with something completely unique to us."" The design for the Discovery went through several revisions and refinements before the final version was approved in December 2016. The sickbay on the Discovery was inspired by that of the Enterprise from The Original Series. Other Federation starships created for the show include the USS Shenzhou and the USS Europa. Sets for the Discovery's interiors were described as a ""tangle of corridors and rooms"", and were designed to match with the exterior design of the ship, so ""the rooms [could believably] fit inside the house"", but there was some artistic license taken in places. The graphics used for the Starfleet computer systems were designed to be believably more advanced than modern technology, but to also ""honor the look and feel"" of the designs used in previous series. The initial colors allowed for the graphics were mostly restricted to blues, with the intention of these becoming more colorful the closer the series gets to the time period of The Original Series.The opening title sequence for the show was created by Prologue using 2D motion graphics. The sequence, which uses a ""vivid, sepia-soaked palette"", depicts elements from throughout the history of Star Trek—such as phasers, communicators, and the Vulcan salute—and deconstructs them. Prologue creative director Ana Criado ""wasn't all that versed"" in Star Trek before beginning work on the sequence, which proved to be an advantage when the series' producers asked for the sequence to be unlike any previous Star Trek titles sequence. A theme of ""blueprints"" was decided for the sequence to acknowledge that it is a prequel, ""literally deconstructing Trek iconography"". Criado explained that original plans were for the sequence to be in black and white, but this was found to be too ""cold"" and was replaced with a Renaissance-inspired sepia look ""to make it look like we are designing everything from scratch"". The sequence was completed before the theme music for the series was finalized. When updating the sequence for the second season to deconstruct new elements specific to that story—including the Captain's chair and the ""Red Angel""—Prologue was able to match the rhythm of the music more closely than they were for the first season. The sequence was updated again for the third season. The third season also introduces a new logo for the series to reflect its move to the far future. Kurtzman felt this was especially important since the series' initial logo had been reflective of the first season's Klingon storyline, which the series had now moved on from.

Section: Filming (2):
Star Trek: Discovery is filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios. Some of the series' sets took over six weeks to create, and new sets were being built up until the end of production of the season. Discovery took advantage of multiple soundstages at the studio, including the largest soundstage in North America. Some episodes for the show were filmed solely on existing sets, making them bottle episodes, though Harberts said the series would not do anything ""as bottle-y as 'everyone is stuck in the mess hall!'"" Various scenes from the show have been filmed on locations around Toronto, including the Aga Khan Museum and the Scarborough Bluffs.For the visual scope of the series, Kurtzman felt that the show had to ""justify being on a premium cable service"". The showrunners were particularly inspired by Star Trek: The Motion Picture and its ""wider scope"", with Harberts explaining that the series is shot in a 2:1 aspect ratio which ""just lends itself to a very lyrical way of telling the story."" He added that some of the series' visuals were influenced by the modern Star Trek films from J. J. Abrams. Some of these influences, per Goldsman, are ""the ability to be creative cinematically...the intimate discourse, the humanistic storytelling with the giant canvas that is Star Trek. A more kinetic camera, a more dynamic way of existing"". The producers worked closely with pilot director David Semel to make the series look as cinematic as possible, including filming the bridge of Starfleet's ships in such a way as ""not to shoot in a sort of proscenium box...to be able to get the camera into spaces where, you know, to shoot it in interesting ways, which is a combination of choreographing a scene to motivate the camera moving, and also lighting."" The cinematographers wanted to emphasize on-set sourcing, with lighting built in wherever it would naturally appear to help create a more realistic feel, and distance the series from the ""stage"" feel of The Original Series. The lighting could also be controlled to create completely different situations, such as the lighting of a Starfleet red alert. Harberts said that the cinematographers wanted the series to have a ""Rembrandt texture"". The second season used a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.

Section: Visual effects (2):
Visual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the initial writing period, with Fuller explaining that the series would require such things as ""digital augmentation on certain alien species"" and ""the transporter beams"". He said, ""We're trying to cultivate distinct looks for all of those things that are unique to our version of Star Trek and carry through the themes we love seeing in fifty years of Star Trek, but doing a slightly different approach."" Pixomondo is the primary visual effects vendor for the series, with Spin VFX and Crafty Apes also working on the show. Kurtzman noted that the series utilizes multiple CG environments which take several months to properly render. The shuttle bay of the Discovery is completely computer-generated, with actors performing in front of a green screen for scenes in that environment; using the digital set is more expensive than any other set created for the series, including the practically-built ones.

Section: Music (2):
The first teaser for the series featured music composed by Fil Eisler, which he ""threw together as an audition"" within three weeks. Before production on the series began, Charles Henri Avelange had also composed and recorded music as ""a showcase for CBS"", while both Cliff Eidelman and Austin Wintory were considered for the series' composer.In July 2017, Jeff Russo was announced as composer for the series. Russo recorded the series' score with a 60-piece orchestra, at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Bros. Studios in California. The show's main theme incorporates elements from the original Star Trek theme by Alexander Courage. Russo acknowledged that not all existing Star Trek fans were going to appreciate the new theme, but felt that regardless of how some felt it compared to previous themes in the franchise it still accurately represented this series.Individual soundtrack albums for the two chapters of the first season were respectively released on December 15, 2017, and April 6, 2018. A soundtrack album for the second season was released on July 19, 2019.

In August 2018, Egyptian video game developer Anas Abdin announced that he would be suing CBS for allegedly infringing his creative property by copying elements of his unreleased video game Tardigrades, including large tardigrades that help humans travel through the universe instantly, and similar characters. The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Lorna G. Schofield in September 2019, finding that the series and video game were not ""substantially similar as a matter of law"", and that the only similarities were the space setting and the use of alien tardigrades. Abdin appealed this dismissal, but the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Schofield's decision in August 2020.

Created by Natxo López, the series stars Daniel Grao, Carolina Lapausa, Melanie Olivares, Ana María Orozco, and Adriana Paz, among others. It follows Antonio (Grao), who travels to Bogotá to search for the man who years before kidnapped his daughter in Valencia. The series was pre-launched on streaming platform Atresplayer Premium on January 10, 2020. The series premiered on Antena 3 on January 14, 2020.The series was also launched by Netflix in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America on June 5, 2020, and worldwide on October 23, 2020.",,,"Opening Shot: In a well-appointed hotel room in Bogota, Colombia, a man gets out of bed and chokes down a number of huge capsules with white powder in them.The Gist: Spanish national Antonio Santos (Daniel Grao) nervously gets through customs at the airport, and switches security lines. When the drug-sniffing dog goes crazy, he runs, and customs agents catch him. Those capsules turn out to be cocaine, so he’s tossed in a holding cell while he awaits arraignment. As he’s arrested, a slight grin of satisfaction crosses his face.We first see the public defender, Angelita Moreno (Adriana Paz), having sex with an older, paunchy bald dude. He invites her to sleep over, but she gets called in to work. One of the cases she has to work on is Antonio’s. When she questions him, he seems completely cool and collected, something that raises red flags for her. She’s not a public defender by choice; she is doing the work as community service for a drunk driving conviction. Her main client is Noberto Quitombo (Fernando Solórzano), a notorious drug kingpin. The judge — who happens to be the guy Angelita was screwing the night before — lets him out on a very makeable bail. Angelita asks him to figure out where the “Spanish drug mule” she’s representing came from.As Antonio rots away in that holding cell, fending off violent men who will beat you for eating bread off the floor, the thinks back to what brought him there: Being with his wife Inma (Carolina Lapausa) and daughter Soledad (Daniela Soneira). One day, as she’s playing on the beach, she disappears. Her parents and the police look for her, but can’t find her. However, a boy who found her pendant on the beach is brought in, and Inma is determined to find out what he and his older brother know.Back in the present day, Angelita, who we find out has a drinking problem and a husband and family she’s cheating on, tries to get to the bottom of why Antonio is there. Drug mules don’t usually stay at luxury hotels the night before they smuggle drugs. Why did he take such a risk? As we see in the holding cell when a fellow Spaniard gets some info, Antonio is looking to get thrown into Colombia’s most notoriously violent prison, hoping to find the man that took Soledad.What Shows Will It Remind You Of? The plot of Stolen Away (original title: Perdida), at least the portion where a man purposely gets himself thrown into a maximum-security prison, reminded us of the Mexican series The Inmate. But the reason why each show’s protagonist gets themselves thrown in prison is completely different.ur Take: What surprised us the most about Stolen Away, created by Natxo López, Ruth García and David Oliva, isn’t the twist that Antonio got himself purposely thrown in prison, it was the rest of the main characters’ stories. That’s why the show is intriguing after the first episode; it’s not just about some guy navigating a violent prison; it’s about the entire story surrounding why he did it, and where he goes from there.It’s not that the twist of why Antonio got himself tossed in the clink was telegraphed, exactly, but it did seem from the start that he was trying to get himself in the max-security prison, despite Angelita’s best efforts. When his fellow Spaniard points out that the customs officers saw him purposely go to the security line with the drug-sniffing dog, you knew what his story was, especially when we saw flashbacks of Antonio and Inma with their daughter Soledad. What we’re intrigued with is how Antonio and Inma managed to track the man who took their daughter to that Colombian prison. We’ll see that in flashbacks, most likely.The more intriguing story is Angelita’s; she’s from Mexico, came to Colombia for her marriage, and has a significant dark side. She drinks whenever she can, and despite having dubious ethics, is a dogged investigator. Will her dark side get the better of her as she tries to help Antonio? How about her connections to the cartel? It makes for a mix that has us interested, especially given a performance from Paz that effectively mixes confidence and self-doubt.Another twist we didn’t quite see coming is what happened to Soledad. She’s still alive, a teenager now (played by Veronica Velasquez), meaning she’s been in captivity for the better part of a decade. She has nightmares about her abduction, but what’s happened to her in the interim will also be interesting to examine.Sex and Skin: Only Angelita’s extremely clothed sex with the judge. We also see her pulling up her lace panties after a session with the same judge in his chambers.Parting Shot: A teenage Soledad looks out the window of her room and we see that she’s living in a well-fortified mansion, with armed guards patrolling outside.Sleeper Star: Carolina Lapausa has more of a role as Inma than what we see in the first episode. And, despite the fact that it seems like she and Antonio are no longer married, she’ll be a big influence on him to do whatever it takes to find Soledad.Most Pilot-y Line: A security guard at the jail tells Angelita that she has “the best booty in Bogota.” “Cutie, if your wife knew, she’d tell you to fuck off,” she replies. We guess that’s supposed to show how tough she is, but it’s just a clunky exchange.Our Call: STREAM IT. Stolen Away has the potential to be a fascinating story about some interesting main characters, or it could go completely off the rails. Either way, the first episode gave us more than enough reason to keep watching.",7.1,1708,Negative,0.826

Suits first appeared on USA Network's development slate under the title A Legal Mind in April 2010. On April 5, 2010, USA announced that it was developing seven new pilots for its 2010–2011 television season, including A Legal Mind, which would later become Suits.  The premiere was written by Aaron Korsh, and David Bartis and Gene Klein served as executive producers.Creator Aaron Korsh, whose Notes from the Underbelly sitcom was canceled during the 2007–2008 Writers' strike, wrote a spec script intended to be a ""half-hour Entourage-type based on my experiences working on Wall Street."" He later realized that the project should have hour-long episodes.  Korsh and his agent took the script to several production companies and wanted to give the script to Universal Media Studios.  However, Korsh found it odd that the studio did not want to sell the script to NBC, the network the studio typically worked with.  Korsh's agent convinced USA Network executive Alex Sepiol that although the series was neither a procedural nor what the network typically did, he would like the characters.  Sepiol approved of the script, and by then, Hypnotic Films & Television signed on to the project.  The team pitched the script to USA network, which bought the script after the pitch. Korsh did not pitch it to anyone else.  When rewriting the script, Korsh made only small changes to the first half-hour, up to when Mike is hired.  Originally, Mike did not take LSATs for others and only pretends to have attended Harvard, as opposed to pretending he attended Harvard and has a law degree.  Korsh noted that there is no degree or test needed, to work on Wall Street and be a mathematical genius, unlike the bar examination in law.  He decided to ""embrace"" this difference and change the premise.The pilot episode was filmed in New York City, where the series is set.  The rest of the series is filmed in Toronto (at Downsview Park Studios), where the sets are built to be identical to the New York law offices seen in the pilot. To promote the series debut, USA had an advance screening of the pilot on June 2, 2011, at the Hudson River Park and distributed free Häagen-Dazs Sundaes cones at the viewing.  The network also had a branded ice cream carts, bikes, and scooters give away at the Sundaes and USA/Entertainment Weekly 2011 promotion summer guides on June 22 and 23. They also held the promotion in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston to endorse the pilot.

The series began filming in Toronto on April 25, 2011, and completed on August 12, 2011, in New York City. Post production for the series was done at Cherry Beach Sound. ""Greenback Boogie"" by Ima Robot serves as the theme song of the show and was released as a single on September 18, 2010, and is included on the band's third album, Another Man's Treasure.
A deleted scene leaked onto YouTube shows Victor Garber as Phillip Hardman, originally part of the pilot, but was ultimately cut during script rewrites. It shows that Hardman had retired from the firm on his own accord. Despite being cut for American audiences, the scene was left in for British viewers when it was first aired, and the scene continues to be included in re-runs.

Suits has received positive reviews on Metacritic. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 91% approval rating with the Season 3 consensus reading, ""Though it's occasionally overly wordy, Suits stimulates with drama derived from the strength of its well-developed characters' relationships."" Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club said, ""Suits has more internal forward momentum than [al]most anything else on television right now, and when it's on, like it mostly is here, it just cooks."" Julie Hinds of The Detroit Free Press said, ""The combination of Gabriel Macht as slick attorney Harvey Specter and Patrick J. Adams as unlicensed legal genius Mike Ross has been a winning one.""

It was praised by viewers for its ""high-quality visual effects"" and ""the deep human connections among the characters."" However, many criticized the soundtrack which they believe did not fit with the story, as well as the lack of monsters in the latter episodes of the season. On this, director Lee Eung-bok said that ""[he] know[s] some of the viewers were anticipating more gore, but [he] hope[s] they will understand why monsters were absent from some parts of our drama.""

Kavya Christopher of The Times of India gave a rating of 4/5 and said, ""One does not need to be a lover of the horror genre to enjoy this series, thanks to the many underlying plots of the various characters – both big and small. The action is superb, to say the least, and the drama is endearing at various levels."" Joel Keller of Decider said that ""despite its flaws and a premise we’ve seen before, Sweet Home distinguishes itself by its setting and its monsters. We’ll see if the drama between the survivors will keep us watching."" Pierce Conran of South China Morning Post gave a rating of 3/5, saying that ""despite a breathless opening episode and some grisly fun throughout, Sweet Home does not provide much of a story for viewers to get hooked on."" In another mixed review, Meagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting said that ""what sprints out of the gate and sets up an exciting creature-filled horror series quickly comes to a slow crawl zombie apocalypse that we’ve seen many times before. It just swaps out the zombies for monsters."" Similarly, Jonathan Wilson from Ready Steady Cut said that ""Sweet Home gets off to a racing start and never really lets up, leading to a frantic, messy, but ultimately enjoyable binge-watch.""

Filming for the series takes place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia. Production on the pilot occurred during the second quarter of 2013. After the show received a series order, filming occurred for the first season between August 2013 and January 2014. Filming for the second season commenced on July 7, 2014, and concluded on January 23, 2015. The third season was filmed between July 15, 2015, and February 2, 2016. Filming for the fourth season commenced on August 2, 2016, and concluded on January 18, 2017. Filming for the fifth season commenced on August 14, 2017, and wrapped up on January 27, 2018.Post-production work, including ADR recording for the series, was done at the Cherry Beach Sound recording studio.David J. Peterson, who created Dothraki and Valyrian for Game of Thrones, developed the Trigedasleng language for The Grounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to Creole English. The language is called ""Trig"" on the show.
After his constructed language work on Star-Crossed, Peterson was contacted by the producers of The 100 to create a language for the Grounders, an evolution of English. In the setting, 97 years have passed since the apocalypse, which is a very short time for significant language change. Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution in which the early Grounders used a cant specifically to obfuscate their speech and to differentiate between friend or foe. Trigedasleng derives from that cant and evolved over several short generations of survivors of the apocalypse.On March 12, 2020, Warner Bros. Television shut down production on all of their shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, writer Kim Shumway confirmed they were able to complete filming for their seventh season.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds a 93 percent average approval rating across its seven seasons. Its first season has a 76 percent approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an average score of 6.98/10. The site's consensus reads: ""Although flooded with stereotypes, the suspenseful atmosphere helps make The 100 a rare high-concept guilty pleasure"".On Metacritic, the first season scores 63 out of 100 points, based on 26 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".The second season was met with more favorable reviews, holding a rating of 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with an average score of 8.77/10. The site's consensus reads: ""The 100 hones all of the things that make it tick for a dynamic second season complete with fast-paced storylines, vivid visuals, and interesting characters to root for -- or against."" In a review of the second-season finale, Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club said, ""Very few shows manage to really push the boundaries of moral compromise in a way that feels legitimately difficult. Breaking Bad did it. The Sopranos did it. Game of Thrones has done it. Those shows never back down from the philosophical murkiness of their worlds, refusing to provide a tidy, happy ending if it doesn't feel right. With 'Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two,' The 100 has done the same, presenting a finale that doesn't shy away from the morally complex stakes it's spent a whole season building up"". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post, in another positive review, wrote: ""I can say with some assurance that I've rarely seen a program demonstrate the kind of consistency and thematic dedication that The 100 has shown in its first two seasons. This is a show about moral choices and the consequences of those choices, and it's been laudably committed to those ideas from Day 1"".The third season received an overall rating of 83 percent based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7.29/10. The Critical consensus is, ""The 100 goes macro in season 3, skillfully expanding the literal scope of the setting and figurative moral landscape"". Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote in an early review of the third season: ""When looking at the epic feel and varied array of stories on display in season three, which overtly and covertly recalls ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga in a number of ways, it's almost hard to recall how limited the scope and the ambitions of ""The 100"" were two years ago, when a rag-tag band of survivors first crash-landed on Earth. In season three (which the cast and showrunner previewed here), the show is more politically complicated than ever, and the world-building that accompanies the depiction of various factions, alliances and conflicts is generally admirable"". In a review of the season 3 finale ""Perverse Instantiation: Part Two"", Mariya Karimjee of Vulture.com wrote: ""Every moment of this finale is pitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing, and the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. ""Perverse Instantiation: Part Two"" elevates the season's themes and pulls together its disparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four"". In another review of the season 3 finale and the season overall, Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club wrote: ""Before we even get to tonight's action-packed finale of The 100, it needs to be said that this has been a rocky season. The first half of it was defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second half of this season has done some work to bring the show back from the brink, focusing on the City of Light and issues of freewill and difficult moral choices, bringing some much needed depth to the third season. That work pays off with ""Perverse Instantiation: Part Two,"" a thrilling, forward-thinking finale that provides some necessary closure to this season"". He gave the finale itself an ""A-"" rating.The fourth season is generally considered to be an improvement over the third season, receiving a 93 percent with an average rating of 8.22/10 based on 14 reviews. The critical consensus is, ""Season 4 of The 100 rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their favorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their thrilling circumstances"". The second portion of the fourth season has received better reception than the first portion, with the episodes Die All, Die Merrily and Praimfaya often cited as the two best episodes of the season. Die All, Die Merrily has a 9.5/10 rating from IGN, a perfect 5/5 rating from Vulture and a perfect A rating from The AV Club. Praimfaya has a 9.0/10 from IGN and an A rating from The AV Club.The fifth season currently has a 100 percent with an average of 8.31/10, based on 13 reviews. The critical consensus is, ""Five years in, The 100 manages to top itself once again with a audacious, addicting season."" This is the highest rating any season of the show has received to date. All episodes of the season received highly positive reviews, but the third episode Sleeping Giants has received particular high acclaim. In a 4.5/5 review from Den of Geek, the episode is described as being a ""good ol' fashioned episode of The 100"", praising its balance of action, humour, and rich relationships. The episode also gained a 4.5/5 rating from TVOverMind, praising the ""pulse-pounding action"" and approach to problem solving.Brian Lowry of The Boston Globe said: ""Our attraction to Apocalypse TV runs deep, as our culture plays out different futuristic possibilities. That's still no reason to clone material, nor is it a reason to deliver characters who are little more than stereotypes"". Allison Keene of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating: ""The sci-fi drama presents The CW's ultimate vision for humanity: an Earth populated only by attractive teenagers, whose parents are left out in space"".
Kelly West of Cinema Blend gave it a more positive review while noting: ""CW's Thrilling New Sci-fi Drama Is A Keeper. CW's The 100 seeks to explore that concept and more with a series that's about equal parts young adult drama, sci-fi adventure and thriller. It takes a little while for the series to warm up, but when The 100 begins to hit its stride, a unique and compelling drama begins to emerge"".IGN's editor Eric Goldman also gave the show a more positive review, writing: ""Overcoming most of its early growing pains pretty quickly, The 100 was a very strong show by the end of its first season. But Season 2 elevated the series into the upper echelon, as the show become one of the coolest and most daring series on TV these days"". Maureen Ryan of Variety named the show one of the best of 2015.In 2016, the year Rolling Stone ranked the show #36 on its list of the ""40 Best Science Fiction TV Shows of All Time"", the episode ""Thirteen"" attracted criticism when Lexa, one of the series' LGBT characters, was killed off. Critics and fans considered the death a continuation of a persistent trope in television in which LGBT characters are killed off far more often than others – implicitly portraying them as disposable, as existing only to serve the stories of straight characters, or to attract viewers. A widespread debate among writers and fans about the trope ensued, with Lexa's death cited as a prime example of the trope, and why it should end. Showrunner Jason Rothenberg eventually wrote in response that ""I (...) write and produce television for the real world where negative and hurtful tropes exist. And I am very sorry for not recognizing this as fully as I should have"".

Sara and Julia are twins and as they and their parents are trying to escape, their father is taken away by the police.We jump to 35 years later – Spain, 2045. Natural resources are now scarce, and, in the name of providing security, western democracies are now dictatorial regimes. Julia, now grown up, goes to drop off alcohol at a brothel. This results in her rescuing a minor from being abused but with disastrous results. On the other hand, Sara sends her daughter Marta, husband Hugo and brother-in-law Alex to stay with her mother, Emilia. That proves to be problematic and the family must now find ways to rescue Marta from the hands of the government. On the other hand, the government has terrible plans up their sleeves.The Barrier episode 1 is mostly expositional and introduces us to all the people who will take on a bigger role in the future. The most harrowing thing about it is how spot-on the show is in regards to the current situation. Be it political or a deadly virus killing people, The Barrier episode 1 talks about things that hits close to home, and probably also provides a sneak-peek into the future.It is also heartbreaking to see what the government has in store for the little children they took away from their parents, and Alma’s idea about their lives with their families.Acting is also solid from all the characters, and all of them get good roles. At 63 minutes, The Barrier episode 1 ends on a tense note, with the minor Julia saved being discovered by the military. The episode does a good job at talking about how horrible people can be when they get power.It’s also harrowing to watch the difference between the commoners and the people of the government. The latter have running water, good food, 24×7 electricity and swanky houses. However, to say that the commoners’ houses are terrible would be an understatement. Says a lot about our world, and probably where we’re heading.",6.8,2537,Positive,0.775

These actors are credited in all episodes of the series:

Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter: An experimental physicist with an IQ of 173, who received his PhD when he was 24 years old. Leonard is a nerd who loves video games, comic books, and Dungeons & Dragons. Leonard is the straight man of the series, in which he shares an apartment in Pasadena, CA, with Sheldon Cooper. Leonard is smitten with his new neighbor Penny when they first meet, and they eventually marry.
Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper: Originally from Galveston, Texas, Sheldon was a child prodigy with an eidetic memory who began college at the age of eleven and earned a PhD at age sixteen. He is a theoretical physicist researching quantum mechanics and string theory, and despite his IQ of 187, he finds many routine aspects of social situations difficult to grasp. He is determined to have his own way, continually boasts of his intelligence, and has an extremely ritualized way of living. Despite these quirks, he begins a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler, and they eventually marry.
Kaley Cuoco as Penny: An aspiring actress from Omaha, Nebraska. Penny moves in across the hall from Sheldon and Leonard. She waits tables and occasionally tends the bar at The Cheesecake Factory. After giving up hope of becoming a successful actress, Penny becomes a pharmaceutical sales representative. Penny becomes friends with Bernadette and Amy, and they often hang out in each other's apartments. Penny and Leonard form a relationship and eventually marry.
Simon Helberg as Howard Wolowitz: An aerospace engineer who got his master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Howard is Jewish and lived with his mother, Debbie (Carol Ann Susi). Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, Bernadette and Amy, Howard does not hold a doctorate. He goes into space, training as an astronaut and serving as a payload specialist. Howard initially fancies himself as a womanizer, but he later starts dating Bernadette, and they get engaged and married. Howard also has a tendency to waste money on toys and argues with Bernadette because of his oddly low income as an engineer and her high income as a pharmaceutical biochemist.
Kunal Nayyar as Rajesh Koothrappali: A particle astrophysicist originally from New Delhi, India. Initially, Raj had selective mutism, rendering him unable to talk to or be around women unless under the influence of alcohol. Raj also has very feminine tastes and often takes on a stereotypical female role in his friendship with Howard as well as in the group of four men. Raj later dates Lucy (Kate Micucci), who also suffers from social anxiety, but it eventually ends. He later speaks to Penny without alcohol, overcoming his selective mutism. He begins dating Emily Sweeney and their relationship later becomes exclusive. Raj also has a Yorkshire Terrier named Cinnamon.These actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast:

Sara Gilbert as Leslie Winkle (recurring season 1, starring season 2, guest seasons 3, 9): A physicist who works in the same lab as Leonard. In appearance, she is essentially Leonard's female counterpart and has conflicting scientific theories with Sheldon. Leslie has casual sex with Leonard and later Howard. Gilbert was promoted to a main cast member during the second season but resumed guest star status because producers could not come up with enough material for the character. Gilbert returned to The Big Bang Theory for its 200th episode.
Melissa Rauch as Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz (recurring season 3, starring seasons 4–12): A young woman who initially is a co-worker at The Cheesecake Factory with Penny to pay her way through graduate school, where she is studying microbiology. Bernadette is introduced to Howard by Penny; at first, they do not get along, apparently having nothing in common. They date and later get engaged and married. Although generally a sweet and good-natured person, Bernadette has a short fuse and can be vindictive and lash out when provoked.
Mayim Bialik as Amy Farrah Fowler (guest star season 3, starring seasons 4–12): A woman selected by an online dating site as Sheldon's perfect mate. Amy is from Glendale, CA. While she and Sheldon initially share social cluelessness, after befriending Penny and Bernadette she eventually becomes more interested in social and romantic interaction. Her relationship with Sheldon slowly progresses to the point at which Sheldon considers her his girlfriend, and eventually they get married. Amy believes she and Penny are best friends, a sentiment that Penny does not initially share. Amy has a Ph.D. in neurobiology.
Kevin Sussman as Stuart Bloom (recurring seasons 2–5, 7, starring seasons 6, 8–12): A mild-mannered, under-confident owner of a comic book store. A competent artist, Stuart is a graduate of the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design. Though he is socially awkward, he possesses slightly better social skills. Stuart implies he is in financial trouble and that the comic book store now also is his home. He is later invited to join the guys' group while Howard is in space. Stuart gets a new job caring for Howard's mother later. After Mrs. Wolowitz's death, Stuart continues to live in her home, along with Howard and Bernadette, until he finds a place of his own.
Laura Spencer as Emily Sweeney (recurring seasons 7–8, 10, starring season 9): A dermatologist at Huntington Hospital. Emily went to Harvard and delights in the macabre, and she states that she likes her job because she can cut things with knives. Prior to meeting Raj, Emily was set up on a blind date with Howard. After finding Emily's online dating profile, Raj has Amy contact her as his wingman instead. Their relationship becomes exclusive, but Raj later breaks up with Emily when he becomes infatuated with Claire (Alessandra Torresani), a bartender and children's author.

","Section: Production (1):
The show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second pilot produced for the show. A different pilot was produced for the 2006–07 television season but never aired. The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only main characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who are named after Sheldon Leonard, a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. A minor character, Althea (Vernee Watson), appeared in the first scene of both pilots that was retained generally as-is. The first pilot included two female lead characters - Katie, ""a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior"" (played by Canadian actress Amanda Walsh), and Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters (played by Iris Bahr). Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend, and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit ""She Blinded Me with Science"" as its theme song.
Although the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the Internet. On the evolution of the show, Chuck Lorre said, ""We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely, and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal."" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, ""Wow, that would be something. We will see. Show your failures...""The first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows, who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007. Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007. The show is filmed in front of a live audience, and it is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions. Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, Welcome to The Captain. The series returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot, and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.After the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in the 2008–2009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008. With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010–11 season in 2009. In 2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons. In March 2014, the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016–17 season. This marked the second time the series gained a three-year renewal. In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to 12, and running through the 2018–19 television season.Several of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne, including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper), and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.

Section: Science consultants (2):
David Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checked scripts and provided dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props. According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, ""We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... We worked hard to get all the science right.""  David Saltzberg, who has a Ph.D. in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping. He saw early versions of scripts that needed scientific information added to them, and he also pointed out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, had made a mistake. He was usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, was involved.Saltzberg sometimes needed assistance on biology from Mayim Bialik, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.

Section: Theme song (2):
The Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang, and at the concert he improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe. Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially. Although some unofficial pages identify the song title as ""History of Everything,"" the cover art for the single identifies the title as ""Big Bang Theory Theme."" A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set. The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before, released on September 27, 2011. In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20 percent of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money for himself.

Section: Actors' salaries (2):
For the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season. In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000–$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.By season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25 percent of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money. Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and advances towards the back-end. Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the ""mid-six-figure range"", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight. By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.In March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and Nayyar) took a 10 percent pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings. This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000 per episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television. By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500,000 per episode each, with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175,000–$200,000 the duo had been making per episode.

Section: U.S. ratings (2):
The Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83 million viewers. After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010–2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011). During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 18–49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.The sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with ""The Bakersfield Expedition"", with 20 million viewers, a first for the series, which along with NCIS, made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18–49 demographic, trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage, and was third in total viewers, trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football. Season seven of the series opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, ""The Deception Verification"", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.Showrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny. Throughout much of the 2012–13 season, The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012–13 television season, The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0. The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013–14 television season, beaten out by Judge Judy.

The show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings.

The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00 p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service.

The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.The fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011, at 8:00 p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4 million viewers. Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011.

The website's consensus reads, ""Smart, hip, and exuberantly performed, The Bold Type sharply blends its soapy plotting with workplace drama that feels very of-the-moment."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 58 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".Caroline Framke of Vox commended the characterization of the three lead characters, highlighting that they are ""struggling with more down-to-earth, complex issues than the genre that inspired them ever made room to take on,"" while Sonia Saraiya of Variety opines that the relationship between the trio ""is neither saccharine nor unbelievable."" Writing for Vulture, Matt Zoller Seitz praised The Bold Type's ability to balance its visuals and narrative standpoint, namely the series' ""young, gorgeous, impeccably dressed core cast,"" its ""Carrie Bradshaw daydream-vision of what it means to be a New York journalist,"" and how the series ""respects journalism as work, in a way that more outwardly 'serious' narratives about the profession sometimes don't."" Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair complimented the series' tone, specifically ""Freeform's interpretation of 'boldness'—the feel-good, aspirational, Pinterest-friendly kind,"" and how said tone is ""more than O.K.; it's necessary.""Vulture's Seitz continued to praise the series' ""knack for balancing youth-focused melodrama and detailed explorations of journalistic conundrums"" during its second season and credited the creators of the series for its realistic appeal and for ""grounding the story in lived reality, not just secondhand research."" Conversely, in a column on The New Republic, Rachel Syme criticized the unrealistic nature of the show, asserting that the series ""needs to depict the difficult, ugly side of this business, as well as the cocktail parties and the blow-outs."" On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds an approval rating of 100%, with an average rating of 8.76/10 based on 30 reviews. The website's consensus reads, ""The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women's careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.""In a positive review of the first episode of the third season, Hannah Giorgis of The Atlantic echoed Seitz' sentiments regarding the series' realistic appeal and further expressed that the series, with its ""earnest story lines and thoughtful touches, remains a delight to watch."" In a mixed review for Forbes, Linda Maleh questioned the trajectory of the series due to the story's tendency to regress and concluded that when it ""makes these big leaps forward and then takes them back, it diminishes its power."" She added that she hoped the regression ""doesn't become a trend for this otherwise wonderful show."" The third season received a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8/10 based on 9 reviews.

Peter Morgan, who wrote the 2006 film The Queen and the play, is the main scriptwriter for The Crown. The directors of the first season are Stephen Daldry, Philip Martin, Julian Jarrold, and Benjamin Caron. The first ten-part season was the most expensive drama produced by Netflix and Left Bank Pictures to date, costing at least £100 million. A second season was commissioned, with the series intended to span sixty episodes over six seasons. By October 2017, ""early production"" had begun on an anticipated third and fourth season, and by the following January, Netflix confirmed the series had been renewed for third and fourth seasons.In January 2020, Morgan announced that the series had been renewed for a fifth and final season. Speaking to ending the series with five seasons, after it had been intended to last six, Morgan said while crafting the stories for season five, ""it has become clear to me that this is the perfect time and place to stop""; Netflix and Sony supported Morgan's decision. However, in July 2020, Netflix announced that the series would receive a sixth season as originally intended. Morgan said that when the storylines were being discussed for season five, ""it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons"". He added that the final two seasons would enable them ""to cover the same period in greater detail"".

By November 2014, Claire Foy had entered negotiations to portray Queen Elizabeth II. By May 2015, Vanessa Kirby was in negotiations to portray Princess Margaret. In June 2015, John Lithgow was cast as Winston Churchill and Matt Smith was cast as Prince Philip, while Foy was confirmed as Queen Elizabeth II. Also starring in the first season were Victoria Hamilton, Jared Harris, and Eileen Atkins.The Left Bank producers noted that Smith was paid more than Foy for the first two seasons, partly because of his Doctor Who fame. This led to a gender pay gap controversy, including the creation of a petition asking Smith to donate the difference between his and Foy's salary to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. Left Bank later apologised to Foy and Smith for putting them ""at the center of a media storm... through no fault of their own"". Left Bank also clarified that they ""are responsible for budgets and salaries; the actors are not aware of who gets what, and cannot be held personally responsible for the pay of their colleagues"". They added that they support ""the drive for gender equality in film and TV and [were] eager to talk to the British Time’s Up campaign and [were] already speaking to Era 50:50, a group campaigning for gender equality on screen and stage"". Suzanne Mackie, Left Bank's creative director, did note that in future no actor would be paid more than the actress portraying the Queen. Regarding the controversy, Foy was ""not [surprised about the interest in the story] in the sense that it was a female-led drama. I'm not surprised that people saw [the story] and went, 'Oh, that's a bit odd'. But I know that Matt feels the same that I do, that it's odd to find yourself at the center [of a story] that you didn't particularly ask for."" Smith noted that he supported Foy and was ""pleased that it was resolved and [the producers] made amends for it because that's what needed to happen"". The Hollywood Reporter noted it was unclear what Smith was referring to as resolved, since Netflix and Left Bank had not commented further. Foy later described reports that she had received backpay to bring her salary up to parity as ""not quite correct"".The producers recast the continuing roles with older actors every two seasons, as the timeline moves forward. In October 2017, Olivia Colman was cast as Queen Elizabeth II for the third and fourth seasons. By January 2018, Helena Bonham Carter and Paul Bettany were in negotiations to portray Princess Margaret and Prince Philip, respectively, for these seasons. However, by the end of the month Bettany was forced to drop out due to the time commitment required. By the end of March 2018, Tobias Menzies was cast as Prince Philip for the third and fourth seasons. In early May 2018, Bonham Carter was confirmed to have been cast, alongside Jason Watkins as Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The next month, Ben Daniels was cast as Tony Armstrong-Jones for the third season, along with Erin Doherty joining the series as Princess Anne. A month later, Josh O'Connor and Marion Bailey were cast as Prince Charles and the Queen Mother, respectively, for the third and fourth seasons. In October 2018, Emerald Fennell was cast as Camilla Shand. In December 2018, Charles Dance was cast as Louis Mountbatten. In April 2019, Emma Corrin was cast as Lady Diana Spencer for the fourth season. Gillian Anderson, who had been rumoured since January 2019 to be in talks to portray Margaret Thatcher in the fourth season, was officially confirmed for the role in September 2019.In January 2020, Imelda Staunton was announced as succeeding Colman as the Queen in the fifth season, with her role in the final season reported in July. Also in July 2020, Lesley Manville was announced as portraying Princess Margaret, and the following month, Jonathan Pryce and Elizabeth Debicki had been cast as Prince Philip and Diana, Princess of Wales, respectively. In October 2020, Dominic West was in talks to play Prince Charles.

An estimated 25% of the first season was filmed at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, with the remainder filmed on location, altogether taking 152 days. Sets for private quarters, the interior of a private jet, the cabinet room, and the exterior of 10 Downing Street, were built at Elstree Studios, while Lancaster House, Wrotham Park and Wilton House were used to double as Buckingham Palace. Ely Cathedral and Winchester Cathedral stood in for Westminster Abbey, while locations in South Africa doubled as Kenya. Additional locations in the UK included Waddesdon Manor, Eltham Palace, the Royal Naval College, Goldsmiths' Hall, Shoreham Airport, New Slains Castle, Balmoral Castle, Cruden Bay, Lyceum Theatre, Loseley Park, Hatfield House, The Historic Dockyard Chatham, Southwark Cathedral, Ardverikie House, Englefield House, Wellington College, the Great Central Railway (heritage railway) and the Glenfeshie Estate. Filming on the second season began in early October 2016. Each episode of the first two seasons would shoot for about 22 days, with each costing about £5 million to produce. The third season began filming in July 2018, and concluded in February 2019. The fourth season began filming in August 2019 and wrapped in March 2020. The fifth season is set to begin filming in June 2021, with season six filming in 2022. The year break in filming between the end of season four and the start of season five was built into the series's production schedule and was not related to the COVID-19 pandemic.The re-enactment of the removal of King George VI's cancerous lung, originally performed by Sir Clement Price Thomas, was researched and planned by Pankaj Chandak, specialist in transplant surgery at Guy's Hospital, London. Chandak and his surgical team then became part of the actual scene filmed for the show. The surgical model of King George VI was donated to the Gordon Museum of Pathology for use as a teaching aid.

The Crown has been praised as a drama, being described by The Telegraph as ""TV's best soap opera"" and given a 5/5 rating, although some reviewers, such as in The Times, raised concerns that some of the episodes are based on false premises. The series received an overall score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes and 84 on Metacritic.For the first season, Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported 88% approval based on 74 reviews with an average rating of 8.61/10. Its critical consensus reads, ""Powerful performances and lavish cinematography make The Crown a top-notch production worthy of its grand subject"". Metacritic gives the season a score of 81 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". For the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported 89% approval from 83 reviews, with an average of 8.35/10: ""The Crown continues its reign with a self-assured sophomore season that indulges in high drama and sumptuous costumes"". Metacritic holds a score of 87 out of 100, based on 27 critics, with ""universal acclaim"". For the third season, Rotten Tomatoes reported 90% approval based on 100 reviews, with an average of 8.54/10: ""Olivia Colman shines, but as The Crown marches on in reliably luxurious fashion through time it finds space for the characters around her, providing ample opportunity for the appealing ensemble to gleam, too."" Metacritic gives a score of 84 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". For the fourth season, Rotten Tomatoes reports 97% approval from 107 reviews, with an average of 8.62/10. Its critical consensus reads: ""Whatever historical liberties [the season] takes...are easily forgiven thanks to the sheer power of its performances – particularly Gillian Anderson's imposing take on The Iron Lady and newcomer Emma Corrin's embodiment of a young Princess Diana"". On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 85 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".However, the series has also received backlash from British critics and the royal family. British reviewers have criticised the fourth season for being ""inaccurate"" and ""anti-monarchy"". Simon Jenkins writing for The Guardian described it as ""fake history"", ""reality hijacked as propaganda, and a cowardly abuse of artistic licence"" which fabricated history to suit its own preconceived narrative, and argued that ""Morgan could have made his point truthfully"". Royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith criticised the inaccuracies and negative portrayal of the royal family, stating, ""Because The Crown is such a lavish and expensive production, so beautifully acted and cleverly written, and so much attention has been paid to visual details about historical events, viewers are tricked into believing that what they are seeing actually happened"", concluding that ""while the earlier seasons were period pieces, this is recent history, so it seems more cruel in its false depictions"". Following some negative reactions to the fourth season, British culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, suggested that the series should have a fiction warning at the beginning as a disclaimer. In a 2021 interview on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Prince Harry stated he was comfortable with The Crown's portrayal of the royal family, noting that, while as a work of fiction it is ""not strictly accurate"", it did give a ""rough idea"" of the pressures of ""putting duty and service above family and everything else"". The prince also said he would like to be portrayed by Damian Lewis, if he was ever to feature on the series.

","Disney pulling their content from Netflix and gaining millions of subscribers on their own new streaming platform put Netflix in a difficult situation. Many wondered whether Netflix would lose a portion of their subscribers along with the well-loved shows and movies that were pulled. The content left on Netflix did not appear to be enough to fill that mouse ear-shaped void.In response to many quality and quantity related concerns, Netflix confirmed a multiyear partnership with Nickelodeon.While some may see it as a desperate move, the idea of a Netflix and Nickelodeon partnership sounds like a dream to me. Nickelodeon could reenergize productions and ideas that otherwise would have been lackluster. A potential Squidward musical is enough to make future collaborations worthwhile.Whenever Disney or Nickelodeon create new content, especially on streaming services where younger people are more prominent, they put themselves in a risky situation. Regardless of whether your allegiance is primarily to Disney or Nickelodeon, twenty-something fans are incredibly protective of the classic shows and movies they grew up with. Both companies face a tough audience whether they are rebooting an old favorite or creating an entirely new show. Still, the idea of new Nickelodeon content on Netflix is exciting in a way that is different from Disney+ shows. Netflix finally released the first work from the partnership, The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia, on Feb. 17. It’s still unclear whether these new shows have the potential to stick with a generation, but The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia definitely offers some hope.The teen comedy is about a 15-year-old girl with brains beyond her years. Ashley (Paulina Chávez) went to college at age nine and is now a 15-year-old robotics engineer and rocket scientist with a doctorate. Of course, she moves across the country to work at NASA. Ashley leaves behind her mom — clearly, who she got her brains from — and lives with her fun-loving uncle, a retired professional football player.Kid geniuses are not a foreign concept for television in general, let alone Nickelodeon — hello, Jimmy Neutron. Netflix also released Project Mc2 back in 2015. The series intended to empower young girls, especially those who are interested in math and science. Now, The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia is doing the same important work. Specifically, Chávez shows the academic potential that young Latinas can reach. Ashley’s life isn’t too serious, too. The series definitely has many silly, kid-humor moments, as it aims to focus on her attempt to balance her normal kid desires with a brain that is well beyond her years.Chávez rocks as Ashley. Her smile wrecks every awkward nerd stereotype you usually see. Her journey is not a dated “glo up” from weird girl to cool girl. In a pleasing twist, her confidence and cute clothes show her as completely normal. Chávez also proves that productions do not need to cast twenty-somethings to successfully play a character like Ashley.The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia is a great start to the Netflix-Nickelodeon relationship. Whether they create the next iCarly or Victorious or not, their new content will continue reinventing the teen sitcom tropes already on the platform and putting a modern twist on classic characters. The future definitely has a lot of possibilities — and I hope that the Squidward musical is not far off, either.",6.8,811,Positive,0.743

It premiered on NBC on September 19, 2016, and concluded on January 30, 2020 after four seasons and 53 episodes.
Although the plot evolves significantly over the course of the series, the initial premise follows Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a woman welcomed after her death to ""the Good Place"", a highly selective Heaven-like utopia designed and run by afterlife ""architect"" Michael (Ted Danson) as a reward for her righteous life. However, she realizes that she was sent there by mistake and must hide her morally imperfect past behavior while trying to become a better and more ethical person. William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, and Manny Jacinto co-star as other residents of the Good Place, alongside D'Arcy Carden as Janet, an artificial being who assists the residents.
The Good Place received critical acclaim for its writing, acting, originality, setting, and tone. In addition, the first season's twist ending and the show's exploration and creative use of ethics and philosophy have been positively singled out. Among other accolades, the series has received a Peabody Award and three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. It has also been nominated for fourteen Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series for its third and fourth seasons.","Section: Cast and characters (1):

Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased selfish American pharmaceutical saleswoman from Phoenix, Arizona, who seemingly winds up in the Good Place in error after being mistaken for a lawyer who exonerated innocent clients facing death sentences. In order to earn her spot, she recruits Chidi to teach her the fundamentals of becoming a better person.
William Jackson Harper as Chidi Anagonye, a deceased French-speaking Nigerian-Senegalese professor of ethics and moral philosophy who taught at the Sorbonne. Although he has a kind and supportive nature, his inability to make choices frequently leaves him overanxious and indecisive. Assigned as Eleanor's soulmate in Michael's first Good Place experiment, he gives her ethics lessons in an attempt to make her a better person.
Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al-Jamil, a deceased wealthy Pakistani-British philanthropist and fashion model who believes she belongs in the Good Place. She forms an unlikely friendship with Eleanor, who initially dislikes her positive attitude, condescending way of speaking, and tendency to name drop.
D'Arcy Carden as Janet, a programmed guide and knowledge bank who acts as the Good Place's main source of information and can provide its residents with whatever they desire. Later, Janet gains a more humanlike disposition and begins to act differently from the way she was designed.
Carden also portrays multiple Janet iterations throughout the series. Among them are ""Bad Janet"", a Bad Place counterpart specifically designed by the demons to respond to residents in an inappropriate and impolite manner; ""Neutral Janet"", an impartial, robotic version of Janet that works in the Accountant's Office; ""Disco Janet"" who is ""fun, but a lot"" and, for one episode, Janet-versions of Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason.
Manny Jacinto as Jason Mendoza, a deceased amateur Filipino American disk jockey and drug dealer from Jacksonville, Florida, who seemingly winds up in the Good Place by mistake. He is introduced as Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese Buddhist monk who took a vow of silence. Later, Jason proves to be an immature and unintelligent but kindhearted Jacksonville Jaguars and Blake Bortles fan.
Ted Danson as Michael, a Bad Place architect who runs the Good Place neighborhood in which Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason reside. Michael has a fascination with the mundane aspects of human life, like playing with paper clips or searching for one's car keys. In the first-season finale, it is revealed that he has been tricking the four humans all along and is actually a demon torturing them, though he later teams up with and befriends them. ""Michael"" is a Hebrew name meaning ""who is like God"". The character of Michael was based on the archangel Michael.

NBC issued a press release on August 13, 2015 announcing it had given the then-untitled show a 13-episode order based purely on a pitch by Michael Schur. On January 12, 2016, it was announced that Kristen Bell and Ted Danson had been cast in the lead roles for the series. The first synopsis of the show was also released, stating that the show was set to revolve around Eleanor designing her own self-improvement course with Michael acting as her guide – although the afterlife element had always been a part of the series, as Bell has stated she was aware of the first-season finale twist when she signed onto the show.William Jackson Harper was cast as Chris on February 11, 2016, though the character was renamed Chidi. Jameela Jamil was cast as Tessa on February 25, 2016, and her character was renamed Tahani. On March 3, 2016, Manny Jacinto was revealed to have been cast as a ""sweet and good-natured Jason"" whose ""dream is to make a living as a DJ in Southern Florida"". On March 14, 2016, D'Arcy Carden was cast in a series regular role that was announced as ""Janet Della-Denunzio, a violin salesperson with a checkered past"" – although writer Megan Amram later admitted that this was an intentional hoax.

The final premise for the show, including the afterlife element, was ultimately announced on May 15, 2016, when NBC announced its schedule for the 2016–17 TV season.According to Schur, the premise and idea was to include religious elements into the series after doing research on various faiths and groups, but he decided to scrap the plans, instead going for a concept that included all faiths that was diverse and free of religious views. ""I stopped doing research because I realized it's about versions of ethical behavior, not religious salvation,"" he says. ""The show isn't taking a side, the people who are there are from every country and religion."" Schur also points out that the setting (shot in San Marino, California's Huntington Gardens) already had the feeling of a pastiche of different cultures, stating that the neighborhoods will feature people who are part of nondenominational and interdenominational backgrounds that interact with each other regardless of religion.The series' setting and premises, as well as the serialized cliffhangers, were modeled on Lost, a favorite of Schur's. One of the first people he called when he developed the series was Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof. ""I took him to lunch and said, 'We're going to play a game [of] 'Is this anything?'"" He then added ""I imagine this going in the Lost way, with cliffhangers and future storylines.""The first season's surprise twist, that the Good Place was the Bad Place, and Chidi, Eleanor, Jason and Tahani were the four souls chosen because they were best suited to torture each other indefinitely, is very similar in premise to philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre's stage play No Exit, in which three strangers die, are escorted to a single room by a friendly bellhop where they are informed they must co-exist together. They ultimately determine they are entirely incompatible and thus come to the conclusion that ""hell is other people"". The only actors who knew the fictional truth from the start were Danson and Bell.Critics have also suggested resemblances to 1960s surreal TV show The Prisoner in its isolated, rule-bound setting.

On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 78 out of 100, based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".The editors of TV Guide placed The Good Place second among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–17 season. In its review from writer Liam Matthews, ""NBC's new comedy has an impressive pedigree"" (referring to Mike Schur and stars, Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, the latter cited as ""arguably the greatest sitcom actor of all time""). Matthews concludes, ""The hope is that their combined star power can restore NBC's tarnished comedy brand to its former glory.

The site's critical consensus reads, ""A wild philosophical ride to the very end, The Good Place brings it home with a forking good final season.""Several critics have commended the show for its exploration and creative use of ethics and philosophy. Featured topics include the trolley problem thought experiment originally devised by Philippa Foot, the categorical imperative first formulated by Immanuel Kant, T. M. Scanlon's What We Owe to Each Other, and the works of Aristotle and Søren Kierkegaard. Andrew P. Street of The Guardian wrote that ""moral philosophy is the beating heart of the program"" and that the show ""made philosophy seem cool."" Elizabeth Yuko of The Atlantic noted that ""The Good Place stands out for dramatizing actual ethics classes onscreen, without watering down the concepts being described, and while still managing to be entertaining."" For their part, several philosophers have celebrated the show's largely accurate popularization of their line of work, while noting some minor inaccuracies.Several critics have noted that The Good Place is notable for its eschewing of antiheroes and cynical themes in favor of likable characters and a positive message. James Poniewozik of The New York Times explained that ""the most refreshing thing about The Good Place, in an era of artistic bleakness, is its optimism about human nature. It's made humane and sidesplittingly entertaining television out of the notion that people – and even the occasional immortal demon – are redeemable."" Jenna Scherer of Rolling Stone wrote that The Good Place proves that ""slapstick and banter can coexist alongside tragedy and hardship – that a show doesn't need to be self-serious to be serious-minded."" Erik Adams of The A.V. Club praised the show as portraying an ""uncommonly decent TV world"". Stuart Heritage of The Guardian called The Good Place ""relentlessly optimistic"", a quality which Stephanie Palumbo of Vulture called ""a salve for despair in the Trump era"".In 2019, The Good Place was ranked 69th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.

54,The Legend of Korra,United States,Nickelodeon Animation Studio Ginormous Madman,ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks,,Michael Dante DiMartino Bryan Konietzko,23,"Action,Adventure,Science fantasy,Steampunk,Comedy-drama",4,52,"The Legend of Korra (also known as Avatar: The Legend of Korra) is an American animated television series created by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino for Nickelodeon. A sequel to Konietzko and DiMartino's previous series Avatar: The Last Airbender, which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by anime. The Legend of Korra ran for 52 episodes (""chapters""), separated into four seasons (""books""), from April 14, 2012 to December 19, 2014. It has been continued as a comics series.
As with its predecessor, the series is set in a fictional universe in which some people can manipulate, or ""bend"", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the ""Avatar,"" can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar Korra, the successor of Aang from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.
The main characters are voiced by Janet Varney, Seychelle Gabriel, David Faustino, P. J. Byrne, J. K. Simmons and Mindy Sterling, and supporting voice actors include Aubrey Plaza, John Michael Higgins, Kiernan Shipka, Lisa Edelstein, Steve Blum, Eva Marie Saint, Henry Rollins, Anne Heche and Zelda Williams. Several people involved in the creation of Avatar: The Last Airbender (such as designer Joaquim Dos Santos, writer Tim Hedrick and composers Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn) returned to work on The Legend of Korra.
Like its predecessor, The Legend of Korra received critical acclaim. The series has been lauded for its writing and production values, and has been nominated for and won awards such as the Annie Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award, and a Gracie Award. The series was also praised for addressing sociopolitical issues such as social unrest and terrorism, as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of race, gender, and sexual orientation. The series' final scene, intended to depict the beginning of a same-sex romance between Korra and Asami Sato, was unprecedented at the time and has been credited with paving the way for LGBT representation in children's television programming.","Section: Cast and characters (1):
Korra (Janet Varney) is the series' 17-year-old ""headstrong and rebellious"" protagonist, and Aang's reincarnation as the Avatar. Her transformation ""from brash warrior to a spiritual being"", according to DiMartino, is a principal theme of the series. The character was inspired by Bryan Konietzko's ""pretty tough"" sister, and by female MMA fighters, notably Gina Carano.The series focuses on Korra and her friends, sometimes called ""Team Avatar"": the bending brothers Mako and Bolin, and the non-bender Asami. Mako (David Faustino), the older brother, is a firebender described as ""dark and brooding"" The character was named after Mako Iwamatsu, the voice actor for Iroh in the first two seasons of the original series. His younger brother Bolin (P. J. Byrne) is an earthbender described as lighthearted, humorous, and ""always [having] a lady on his arm"". Asami Sato (Seychelle Gabriel), the only non-bender among the leading characters, is the daughter of the wealthy industrialist Hiroshi Sato.The other main characters are the airbending master Tenzin, one of Aang's grown children (J. K. Simmons). Tenzin's family include his wife Pema (Maria Bamford) and their children Jinora (Kiernan Shipka), Ikki (Darcy Rose Byrnes), Meelo (Logan Wells), and Rohan. Jinora is calm and an avid reader. She is an airbender and joins the main cast since season 2; Ikki is described as ""fun, crazy, and a fast talker""; Meelo is hyperactive; and Rohan is born during the third-to-last episode of Book One; Republic City police chief Lin Beifong (Mindy Sterling) and Korra's animal friends Naga and Pabu (both Dee Bradley Baker, the voice of a number of animals including Appa and Momo in the original series). Pabu was inspired by Futa, a famous standing Japanese red panda. Jeff Bennett as the voice for Shiro Shinobi, fast-talking probending match announcer in Book One. He also does the voice-overs for the short recaps during the opening sequence of each episode.
The romantic interests of Korra and her companions are less in the foreground than in Avatar, and feature mainly in the first two seasons. In Book One, Bolin pines for Korra, who is interested in Mako, who dates Asami. By the end of the season, Mako has broken up with Asami and entered a relationship with Korra. This ends around the end of Book Two, during which Bolin suffers from an abusive relationship with the waterbender Eska. In the fourth season, Bolin dates the airbender Opal, while Asami and Korra become closer friends. The series' final scene indicates a romantic connection between them. Mike DiMartino wrote that the scene ""symbolizes their evolution from being friends to being a couple"". They both are in a relationship in comics.

Book One: Air features two main adversaries for Korra: the Equalists' masked leader Amon (Steve Blum) who has the power to remove a person's bending-powers, and the ambitious, charismatic politician Tarrlok (Dee Bradley Baker), who resorts to increasingly repressive methods against the Equalists.  Tenzin's parents Katara (Eva Marie Saint), and Avatar Aang (D. B. Sweeney), main characters of the Avatar: The Last Airbender series, also made recurring appearances, along Chris Hardwick and Kate Higgins voiced Sokka and Toph Beifong, also made guest appearances. Amon's lieutenant is voiced by Lance Henriksen, and Asami's father Hiroshi Sato by Daniel Dae Kim. Sato's character, the self-made founder of Future Industries, was inspired by Theodore Roosevelt and by the Japanese industrialists Keita Goto and Iwasaki Yatarō. Richard Epcar as the voice for Saikhan, captain of the Republic City Metalbending Police Force. Both Amon and Tarrlok are identified as the sons of mob boss Yakone (Clancy Brown). Korra is also supported by General Iroh (Dante Basco, who voiced Zuko in the original series), a member of the United Forces who is described as ""a swashbuckling hero-type guy"". He is named after Iroh, Zuko's uncle in the original series.
Book Two: Spirits features Tenzin's and Korra's families, including Tenzin's elder siblings Kya (Lisa Edelstein) and Bumi (Richard Riehle) as well as Korra's father Tonraq (James Remar) and mother Senna (Alex McKenna). Book 2 also introduces John Michael Higgins as the corrupt businessman and inventor Varrick, with Stephanie Sheh voicing his assistant Zhu Li, along with Korra's uncle Unalaq (Adrian LaTourelle), aided by his twin children Desna (Aaron Himelstein) and Eska (Aubrey Plaza), and Vaatu (Jonathan Adams), the spirit of disorder. Spencer Garrett joined the cast as the voice for Raiko, the president of the United Republic. The season also explains the Avatar mythos though the first Avatar Wan (Steven Yeun) and Vaatu's polar opposite Raava (April Stewart). Making a few appearances in Books Two and Three, Greg Baldwin reprises Iroh from the previous series. Set six months after the events of the first season, Book Two: Spirits sees Mako as a police officer, Asami in charge of Future Industries, and Bolin leading a new pro-bending team with little success.

The anarchist antagonists introduced in Book Three: Change, the Red Lotus, comprise the new airbender Zaheer (Henry Rollins), the armless waterbender Ming-Hua (Grey DeLisle, who previously voiced a dark spirit), the combustionbender P'Li (Kristy Wu), and the lavabender Ghazan (Peter Giles). Supporting characters include the Earth Queen Hou-Ting (Jayne Taini), the retired Fire Lord Zuko (Bruce Davison), Lin's half-sister Suyin Beifong (Anne Heche), Suyin's trusted advisor Aiwei (Maurice LaMarche) and her captain of the guards Kuvira (Zelda Williams). New airbenders are also introduced in the season including the young thief Kai (Skyler Brigmann) and Suyin's daughter Opal (Alyson Stoner), both of Earth Kingdom origins and the love interests of Jinora and Bolin respectively. Jim Meskimen voices a Republic City merchant and later airbender named Daw, as well as Suyin's husband, the architect Baatar. Jason Marsden as the voice for Huan, second oldest son of Suyin, along Marcus Toji voicing  Wei and Wing are the twin sons of Suyin. Greg Cipes as the voice for Tu, the cousin of Mako and Bolin, along Susan Silo voices a their grandmother Yin.
The final season, Book Four: Balance, features Kuvira as Korra's antagonist at the head of an army bent on uniting the Earth Kingdom. The cast is also joined by Sunil Malhotra as Prince Wu, the vain heir to the Earth Kingdom throne, and Todd Haberkorn as Baatar Jr., Suyin's estranged son who is Kuvira's fiancé and second-in-command. Philece Sampler voices the aged Toph Beifong, another returning character from Avatar whose young adult version was voiced by Kate Higgins in Books 1 and 3. April Stewart was cast as Zuko's daughter, Fire Lord Izumi, in a minor role.

Section: Influences (2):
The art design of Republic City, described as ""if Manhattan had happened in Asia,"" was inspired by the 1920s and incorporates influences from American and European architecture from that time period. Elements of film noir and steampunk also influenced the city's art concept. The design for the metalbending police force is based on 1920s New York City police uniforms, crossed with samurai armor.The fighting styles employed by characters in the original show Avatar: The Last Airbender were derived from different distinct styles of Chinese martial arts. Set 70 years later, the fighting style in the multicultural Republic City has modernized and blended, with the creators incorporating three primary styles: traditional Chinese martial arts, mixed martial arts, and tricking. The pro-bending sport introduced in the series was inspired by mixed martial arts (MMA) tournaments.Chinese martial arts instructor Sifu Kisu consulted on Avatar: The Last Airbender, and returned as a consultant for the fight scenes in The Legend of Korra. MMA fighters Jeremy Humphries and Mac Danzig were credited with ""providing a lot of the moves you'll see in the Probending arena,"" and Steve Harada and Jake Huang provided the stylized flips and acrobatics of ""tricking"" to the series' fighting style.

Section: Development (2):
The Legend of Korra was co-created and produced by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. To illustrate the length of the production process (about 10 to 12 months per episode) and the overlap of the various phases, Konietzko wrote in July 2013 that their team was already developing the storyboards for the first episode of Book 4 while the last episodes of Book 2 were not yet finished.Production of the series was announced at the annual Comic-Con in San Diego on July 22, 2010. It was originally due for release in October 2011. Tentatively titled Avatar: Legend of Korra at the time, it was intended to be a twelve-episode mini series set in the same fictional universe as the original show, but seventy years later. In 2011, the title was changed to The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra, and again in March 2012 to The Legend of Korra. The premiere was eventually delayed to April 14, 2012. South Korean animation studio Mir was involved in the pre-production, storyboarding and animation of the series which allows the studio more creative input on directing the martial arts scenes that the series and its predecessor are known for.According to animation director Yoo Jae-myung, Nickelodeon was initially reluctant to approve the series and suspended production because, according to Konietzko, conventional wisdom had it that ""girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls"". The creators eventually persuaded the channel's executives to change their mind. Konietzko related that in test screenings, boys said that Korra being a girl did not matter to them.The creators wrote all of the episodes of the first season themselves, omitting ""filler episodes"" to allow for a concise story. Once the series was expanded from its original 12-episode schedule to 26 and then to 52, more writers were brought in so that the creators could focus on design work. Joaquim Dos Santos and Ryu Ki-Hyun, who worked on the animation and design of the original series, also became involved with creating The Legend of Korra, as is storyboarder Ian Graham. Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who composed the soundtrack for the original series as ""The Track Team,"" also returned to score The Legend of Korra.The second season, Book Two: Spirits, premiered on September 13, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. It consists of fourteen episodes. Animation work was done by the South Korean animation studio Mir as well as the Japanese animation studio Pierrot. Studio Mir was expected to solely work on Book 2, but executive director Jae-myung Yoo decided that Studio Mir would animate The Boondocks instead because the animation process was less rigorous. Pierrot was eventually called in to fill the void and animate Book 2. According to Jae-myung Yoo, Studio Mir was later contacted and re-asked to animate Book 2. Yoo feared that, if Book 2 failed, Studio Mir and Korean animators would have their reputations tarnished for Pierrot's failures. Consequently, Studio Mir accepted the offer and worked alongside Pierrot.The third season, Book Three: Change, aired its first three episodes on June 27, 2014, soon after some episodes were leaked online. It takes place two weeks after the events of Book Two: Spirits. Episodes nine to thirteen were streamed online, rather than being broadcast as a television program.Book Four: Balance, the final season, was produced in parallel to the previous two seasons. The crew, at one point, worked on approximately 30 episodes at the same time: post-production for season 2, production for season 3 and pre-production for season 4. Some production steps, such as color correction and retakes, continued up until the date of the series finale, December 19, 2014. Season 4 started online distribution a few months after the third season's finale on October 3, 2014. After Nickelodeon cut the season's budget by the amount required for one episode, DiMartino and Konietzko decided to include a clip show, which reuses previously produced animation, as episode 8 (""Remembrances"") instead of dismissing many of the creative staff. Studio Mir was helped by its companion studio, a subunit called Studio Reve, while working on Book 4.Concerning the development of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they would not be able to get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands, to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior and the pose made by Aang and Katara in the finale of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Section: Animation style (2):
The Legend of Korra was produced mainly as traditional animation, with most frames drawn on paper in South Korea by the animators at Studio Mir and scanned for digital processing. Each episode comprises about 15,000 drawings. The series makes occasional use of computer-generated imagery for complex scenes or objects, most noticeably in the animations of the pro-bending arena or the mecha-suits of the later seasons.
While The Legend of Korra was produced in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation (""anime"") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) and the quality of its voice acting as well as the visual style are similar to those of leading anime series such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Bleach or Trigun. A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs; to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korra's openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.
As in Avatar, the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in traditional Chinese characters, without translating it. For example, on the ""Wanted"" posters seen in the episode ""The Stakeout"", the names of the protagonists are written as 寇拉 (Korra), 馬高 (Mako) and 愽林 (Bolin).

Section: Music (2):
The Legend of Korra is set to music by Jeremy Zuckerman, who previously wrote the music for Avatar: The Last Airbender with Benjamin Wynn. For The Legend of Korra, Zuckerman is the sole composer while Wynn is the lead sound designer; the two collaborate with Foley artist Aran Tanchum and showrunner Mike DiMartino on the soundscape of the series. Konietzko and DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On that basis, Zuckerman composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration. It is performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments, including a dizi (flute), paigu (drums), a guqin, an erhu and a Mongolian matouqin.A soundtrack CD, The Legend of Korra: Original Music from Book One, was published on July 16, 2013. Music from Korra and Avatar was also played in concert at the PlayFest festival in Málaga, Spain in September 2014. The series's soundtrack was nominated as best TV soundtrack for the 2013 GoldSpirit Awards.

The series premiere averaged 4.5 million viewers, ranking it as basic cable's number-one kids' show and top animated program for the week with total viewers. The Legend of Korra also ranks as the network's most-watched animated series premiere in three years.Book One: Air drew an average of 3.8 million viewers per episode. This was the highest audience total for an animated series in the United States in 2012.Book Two: Spirits premiered with 2.6 million viewers. Suggested explanations for the reduced number of broadcast viewers were: the long period between seasons, a change in time slot (Friday evening instead of Saturday morning), the increased availability of digital download services, and generally reduced ratings for the Nickelodeon channel.Book Three: Change aired on short notice in June 2014 after Spanish-language versions of some episodes were leaked on the Internet. The season premiered with 1.5 million viewers. After declining TV ratings in the third season, Nickelodeon stopped airing the series on its main network and shifted its distribution to sister channel, Nicktoons and online outlets. The online distribution is where the show had proven to be much more successful.

Writing for Vulture, Matt Patches highlighted the second season's loose, handheld-style cinematography – challenging for an animated series – and the ""weird, wonderful"", wildly imagined spirits fought by Korra; ""a Kaiju parade with beasts that mirror velociraptors"". Max Nicholson for IGN described the third season as ""easily the show's most consistent season to date, delivering complex themes, excellent storylines and unmatched production values."" And Oliver Sava, for The A.V. Club, characterized it as a ""truly magnificent season of television, delivering loads of character development, world building, socio-political commentary, and heart-racing action, all presented with beautifully smooth animation and impeccable voice acting"".The styling of the setting – a fusion of Asian and early 20th century American elements – was noted by critics as ""beautiful and innovative"", but criticized for cultural appropriation by a non-diverse creative team and voice cast, and for jettisoning ""authentic cultural traditions in favor of embracing white industrialized civilization"".

Section: Writing and themes (3):
Before the first season's finale, Scott Thill of Wired hailed The Legend of Korra as ""the smartest cartoon on TV,"" able to address adults' spiritual and sociopolitical concerns while presenting an ""alternately riveting and hilarious ride packed with fantasy naturalism, steampunk grandeur, kinetic conflicts, sci-fi weaponry and self-aware comedy."" In The Atlantic, Julie Beck characterized the series as ""some of the highest quality fantasy of our time"", appreciating it for combining nuanced social commentary with Avatar: The Last Airbender's ""warmth, whimsy, and self-referential wit"". Brian Lowry of Variety felt that the series ""represents a bit more ambitious storytelling for older kids, and perhaps a few adults with the geek gene.""At TV.com, Noel Kirkpatrick commented favorably on how the second season of ""one of television's best programs"" handled the necessary quantity of exposition, and on its introduction of the theme of conflict between spiritualism and secularism. Covering the third season, Scott Thill at Salon described Korra as one of the toughest, most complex female characters on TV, despite being in a cartoon, and considered that the ""surreal, lovely sequel"" to Avatar ""lastingly and accessibly critiques power, gender, extinction, spirit and more — all wrapped up in a kinetic 'toon as lyrical and expansive as anything dreamt up by Hayao Miyazaki or George Lucas"". David Levesley at The Daily Beast recommended the series to those looking for ""beautifully shot and well-written fantasy on television"" after the end of Game of Thrones's most recent season, noting that in both series ""the fantastical and the outlandish are carefully balanced with human relationships and political intrigue"".Several reviewers noted the sociopolitical issues that, unusually for an animated series on a children's channel, run through The Legend of Korra. According to Forbes, by telling ""some of the darkest, most mature stories"" ever animated, The Legend of Korra has created a new genre, ""the world's first animated television drama"". Thill proposed that the Equalists' cause in season 1 reflected the recent appearance of the Occupy movement, and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before Occupy Wall Street began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted ""a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power."" Beck wrote that The Legend of Korra used magic to illustrate ""the growing pains of a modernizing world seeing the rise of technology and capitalism, and taking halting, jerky steps toward self-governance"", while portraying no side of the conflict as entirely flawless. Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon's Equalists reflected some of the ideas of John Rawls' ""luck egalitarianism"", praising the series for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.Writing for The Escapist, Mike Hoffman noted how the series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing, but also giving emotional weight to the death of major characters, including ""one of the most brutal and sudden deaths in children's television"" in the case of P'Li in season 3. By portraying Korra's opponents not as stereotypical villains, but as human beings with understandable motivations corrupted by an excess of zeal, the series trusted in viewers to be able to ""resolve the dissonance between understanding someone's view and disagreeing with their methods"". And, Hoffman wrote, by showing Korra to suffer from ""full-on depression"" at the end of the third season, and devoting much of the fourth to her recovery, the series helped normalize mental health issues, a theme generally unaddressed in children's television, which made them less oppressive for the viewers.

Section: Gender, race and sexual orientation (3):
Summing up Book Four, Joanna Robinson for Vanity Fair described it as ""the most subversive television event of the year"", noting how much of the season and series pushed the boundaries of what is nominally children's television by ""breaking racial, sexual, and political ground"": It featured a dark-skinned female lead character as well as a bevy of diverse female characters of all ages, focused on challenging issues such as weapons of mass destruction, PTSD and fascism, and was infused with an Eastern spirituality based on tenets such as balance and mindfulness. Levesley also highlighted the ""many examples of well-written women, predominantly of color"" in the series. Oliver Sava at The A.V. Club noted that the series had ""consistently delivered captivating female figures""; he considered it to be first and foremost about women, and about how they relate to each other ""as friends, family, and rivals in romance and politics"".Moreover, according to Robinson, the series' final scene, in which Korra and Asami gaze into each other's eyes in a shot mirroring the composition of Avatar's final moments in which Aang and Katara kiss, ""changed the face of TV"" by going further than any other work of children's television in depicting same-sex relationships – an assessment shared by reviewers for TV.com, The A.V. Club, USA Today, IGN, Moviepilot and The Advocate. Mike Hoffman, on the other hand, felt that Korra and Asami's relationship was not intended as particularly subversive, but as something the writers trusted younger viewers, now often familiar with same-sex relationships, to be mature enough to understand. Megan Farokhmanesh of Polygon wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as bisexual, the series even avoided the error of assuming sexual orientation, as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between ""gay"" and ""straight"". In 2018, io9 ranked the series' final scene #55 on its list of ""The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years"". As Korra was made widely available again on Netflix in 2020, Janet Varney called her role as the voice of Korra ""the most profound and meaningful part of my career"" on account of the impact the ending had on queer fans. Vanity Fair said that the show’s creators ""fought hard"" for the ending with Asami and Korra, which has ""plausible deniability that it’s all platonic.""The Washington Post and Vulture have since credited The Legend of Korra with changing the landscape of LGBT representation in western animated children's cartoons, paving the way for more overt queer content in shows such as Adventure Time and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.

This historical drama portrays the rise and fall of the eponymous early-18th century pirate republic based in Nassau, Bahamas. The series begins in 1715, shortly after the close of the War of the Spanish Succession, which pitted England against Spain. England had waged the war on the cheap, resorting to the use of privateers rather than incurring the expense of fully funding the Royal Navy.",,,"Half informative, half entertaining, this series offers a lively interpretation of the roughly 12-year reign of piracy throughout the Caribbean islands following the War of Spanish Succession. From the plundering and stealing of ships carrying gold, jewels, and slaves to the creation of a Pirate Republic in the Bahamian village of Nassau, it reveals how postwar politics and economics, the slave trade, and natural phenomena all combined to play a role in the massive increase in piracy in the region at that time. Adding to this are humorous, and often ruthlessly violent, actor performances that create a theatrical picture of what the pirates' lives and deaths would have been like. Many of the pirates featured here are recognizable thanks to centuries of pirate folklore and media renditions of this era. However, The Lost Pirate Kingdom focuses only on the end of the Golden Age of Piracy, which spanned from the 1650s through the 1730s. In doing so, it leaves out some of history's greatest, but less talked about, pirate activities, including the Anglo-French Buccaneers, and the members of what is known as ""The Pirate Round,"" when pirates sailed around the world attacking ships traveling to and from what is now the Middle and Far East. Nonetheless, what stories it does tell are captivating, and worth tuning into. ",6.6,1127,Positive,0.983

","It seems like we’re getting a fair amount of stories that involve some sort of inappropriate teacher-student relationship. Some are dealt with quietly, like A Teacher, others have it as part of a larger story (Tiny Pretty Things). But The Mess You Leave Behind, a new Spanish thriller on Netflix, takes this topic and makes it even more foreboding than the other shows do. Read on for more.Opening Shot: A woman is looking at her laptop, when she is startled by her doorbell buzzing and someone knocking. Then, as she copies files to a flash drive, the person tries to get in with his keys.The Gist: The woman knows the person trying to get in; it’s her ex-husband, who is concerned for her safety. She doesn’t let him in, saying “I’m this close to giving up on this shit.”We’re then introduced to a young teacher named Raquel (Inma Cuesta), who dreams that she comes home from shopping just to be told by her husband Germán (Tomar Novas) that her mother, whom she’s been caring for, has passed. But it’s actually a few months later, though her mom’s death still haunts her. She gets a job as a substitute teacher in the village of Galicia; she’ll be taking over a high school literature class from a departed teacher. She and Germán think of it as a fresh start, though he has to deal with living with his newly-widowed mother in the village. Raquel is also dismayed by her husband’s habit of doing blow.Then we see the woman from the first scene, Viruca (Bárbara Lennie), giving a class at the same school a surprise essay-based test about a Sylvia Plath poem about suicide. There’s something going on between her and one of her students, Iago (Arón Piper), but it’s hard to know what. What we do know is that Iago and his girlfriend Nerea (Isabel Garrido) have broken up because of it. Nerea’s essay directly threatens Viruca. Her ex-husband Mauro (Roberto Enríquez) also works at the school.Raquel comes in a day early to get the lay of the land before her first class. She runs into Iago and his buddy Roi (Roque Ruíz) getting into a minor scuffle, and when she confronts them, he tries to scare her off. She also sees Nerea debate about the patriarchy in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Later that day, when she takes her dog for a walk at the hot springs, she sees Roi taking pictures of Iago holding a gun while both are in the warm pools, wearing nothing but skivvies. Iago takes his undies off and Raquel says, “You’re just a kid trying to impress a grown-up woman, and it’s not going to work.”Viruca becomes increasingly unhinged, and we learn pretty quickly that she and Iago had an affair that led to the breakup of her marriage. He confronts her in a staff restroom, and Roi follows him in; Iago is torn to pieces by the hell she’s put him through.On Raquel’s first day of class, she is not only rebuffed by the likes of Iago and Nerea, but right before she enters class she finds out that the teacher she’s replacing committed suicide three weeks prior. Yes, that’s right: She’s Viruca’s replacement.What Shows Will It Remind You Of? This is sort of like A Teacher, but with a more thriller-type of vibe.Our Take: Created by Carlos Montero, The Mess You Leave Behind (Original title: El desorden que dejas) is based on the novel of the same name, and its storytelling technique is either going to be a creative way to tell both Viruca’s and Raquel’s stories or it’s going to be completely distracting. Judging by the first episode, we’re going to go with the former.Montero and his writers did do a good job of seamlessly going back and for between the two timeliness; at some point, viewers are likely to figure out the surprise before it’s actually revealed, but we don’t hold that against the show, because they’re not using this storytelling method as a gimmick; it’s baked into the entire series, to show how Viruca and Iago fell into this forbidden relationship and how Raquel is going to try to pick up the pieces.There’s obviously more to this story that we’re not privy to just yet; for instance, Raquel keeps having vivid dreams involving her mother, who was a doctor when she was alive and healthy. She also seems to have other visions, as you’ll see below. There is something about the school, or the town, that makes people like Viruca bored, or paranoid or both. When she’s grading the test she gives her class on her first day, Raquel comes across Viruca’s “MISSING” poster with the words “How long before you die, too?” scrawled on the back. So there’s a chance Viruca’s death wasn’t a suicide.We’ll be spending the remainder of the 8-episode season examining Viruca’s story and how it affects Raquel. Given how smoothly the first episode went, and the strong performances from both Cuesta as Raquel and Lennie as Viruca, there’s a good chance that these stories will continue to interact seamlessly with each other.Sex and Skin: After encountering Iago and Roi at the hot springs, Raquel has sex with Germán for the first time in a long time. He’s a little rusty. Might be the coke. Anyway, she may be turned on by the fact that he’s a man and Iago is just a silly kid, or she really get turned on by the sight of Iago’s manhoodParting Shot: After her rough first day, Raquel takes a bottle of wine and gets in a steaming hot bath. She envisions a bruised Viruca in the bath with her, then wakes up. Will her visions switch from her mom to Viruca?Sleeper Star: We’re intrigued by how Roi, played by Roque Ruíz, factors into all of this. He found Viruca’s body and he was very emotional as he tried to revive her. Yet, at the hot springs, he was very intrigued by getting into his skivvies with Iago. So in the Viruca-Iago relationship, who was he jealous of? Or was there  more going on?Most Pilot-y Line: In one of Raquel’s dreams, she sees her mother, dressed in a doctor’s lab coat and scrubs. On one hand, the mom says “I’m not even cold yet and you move?” Then, when Raquel says, “You’re dead,” her mother insists she’s not. When she goes to listen to her own heartbeat, she can’t find it, which is when Raquel wakes up. Look, we know dreams can be weird, but this one didn’t make any sense.Our Call: STREAM IT. The fact that we’re not turned off by the two-timeline storytelling technique of The Mess You Leave Behind is a testament to how well the timelines are stitched together. As the season goes along, we hope that the stories continue to be as smoothly told, especially as they wind together.",6.8,6045,Negative,0.854

Kasparov developed critical moments in the story, such as when a real 1998 game between grandmasters Arshak Petrosian and Vladimir Akopian was improved to showcase Beth's skill, or a 1993 game between Vasyl Ivanchuk and Patrick Wolff became the prototype for the decisive game in the last episode.

Section: Production design and filming (2):
Production designer Uli Hanisch developed the series' sets to evoke the aesthetic of the 1950s and 1960s. Much of the series was filmed in Berlin because of how interiors found there could stand in for a large number of the show's locations, including Las Vegas, Cincinnati, Mexico City, Moscow, and Paris.

Locations used in and near Berlin included the Kino International (for a restaurant, actually the Panorama Bar), the Berlin Zoo, the Humana store, Schloss Schulzendorf (for the Methuen Home orphanage), the Rathaus Spandau (for a hotel lobby), Palais am Messe-Funkturm (for the Hotel Mariposa in Las Vegas), the Protestant University of Applied Sciences in Zehlendorf (for the US Championship games location), Haus Cumberland, the Bode Museum (for scenes that take place in Paris), Karl-Marx-Allee (exterior of a hotel said to be in Moscow); the final scene of Beth walking in Moscow was filmed at Rosengarten Square, also in the Karl-Marx-Allee. The Baerensaal (aka Bear hall) was used for scenes set at the Moscow Tournament. The Friedrichstadt-Palast stood in for the Aztec Palace Hotel. The exterior of Henry Clay High School in Lexington was actually filmed at the Max Taut Schule.Some scenes were filmed in Canada; principal photography began in August 2019 in Cambridge, Ontario. For example, The Harmon family home is a house on Brant Road in the city. Other houses where some filming was done are on Salisbury Ave in Cambridge and on Blenheim Road; the latter is a mansion built in the 19th century. The exterior of St. Andrew's College, Aurora (Ontario) was used for the Ohio Championship facility but the interior was actually a Berlin facility. The exterior of the fictional Ben Snyder Department store in Kentucky was filmed at the Winners department store (Front Street and Berczy Park) in Toronto, Ontario, the rural bridge is the Meadowvale Road Bridge in Toronto and the Fairfield High School in the show is actually Western Technical-Commercial School in Toronto. The fictional Bradley's pharmacy was actually an outdoor set built at Walnut and King streets in Hamilton, Ontario.

Section: Music (2):
The musical score was composed by Carlos Rafael Rivera. Frank initially wanted the score to be piano-based only, but in the end decided with Rivera for a full orchestral score for more ""instrumental depth and color"". Rivera found scoring for chess a challenging task, having been warned by Frank that ""music would be doing a lot of heavy lifting"". He decided to reflect Beth's growth – both as a person and a chess player – by adding more and more instrumentation over time.

Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".In a column where she argues ""So many lives would be different if we'd had The Queen's Gambit 50 years ago,"" culture critic Mary McNamara said, ""I loved The Queen's Gambit so much, I watched the final episode three times."" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B and described the lead actress, ""Taylor-Joy excels in the quiet moments, her eyelids narrowing as she decimates an opponent, her whole body physicalizing angry desperation when the game turns against her."" Variety's Caroline Framke wrote ""The Queen's Gambit manages to personalize the game and its players thanks to clever storytelling and, in Anya Taylor-Joy, a lead actor so magnetic that when she stares down the camera lens, her flinty glare threatens to cut right through it."" Reviewing for Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said, ""An aesthetically beautiful project with several superb performances, all in service to a story that starts to feel padded long before the end comes.""Critics also frequently discussed the series' prominent theme of substance abuse. Phoebe Wong notes that ""Interestingly though, unlike other works which study the self-destructive aspects of perfectionist obsession, mental health and substance abuse issues extend beyond the protagonist to other characters"" in her review for The Tufts Daily. Her summary reads ""Impressive in its own right, The Queen's Gambit adopts a fresh perspective by delving into chess' intersections with substance abuse and gender discrimination"". Matt Miller of Esquire stated ""The result is a pretty scary depiction of the stress of competitive chess in the 1960s."" On the other hand, Harper's Bazaar's Lilly Dancyger considered the ""misrepresentation"" of drug abuse to ""nearly ruin the show"" for her, using the following Stephen King quote to explain: ""The idea that the creative endeavor and mind-altering substances are entwined is one of the great pop-intellectual myths of our time.""The Washington Post's Monica Hesse considers the miniseries ""revisionist history"" but also ""a wonderful future"" in that the heroine's ""uncluttered path to success"" is ""uninterrupted by sexism"", and has men ""refreshingly"" looking out for the main female character, noting that the show ""has no women in peril, and no skeezy men"". Carina Chocano of The New York Times Magazine also believes that the show again and again foils the audience's expectations: the janitor doesn't molest her, her adoptive father leaves her alone, and her adoptive mother Alma doesn't hold her back, a departure Chocano attributes to the ""fantasy""-like quality of The Queen's Gambit. Responding to these reviews, Fred Mazelis of the World Socialist Web Site wrote that ""the claims that the series is appreciated because it is fantasy are disingenuous, to say the least. The show has struck a chord precisely because it is not seen as utopian fiction.""
Bethonie Butler, also of The Washington Post, while praising the show overall, criticized the characterization of Jolene, the show's only major Black character, saying ""(her) backstory and character development are so limited that she seems to exist merely to make Beth's life easier"".Many aspects of the series' production values have been praised and discussed, including its location choices, interior design, and wardrobe.

The series received praise from the chess community for its realistic portrayal of the game and players. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Woman Grandmaster Jennifer Shahade said that the series ""completely nailed the chess accuracy"". In an article about the miniseries in The Times, British chess champion David Howell felt that the chess scenes were ""well choreographed and realistic"", while British Women's chess champion Jovanka Houska said, ""I think it's a fantastic TV series ... [i]t conveys the emotion of chess really well."" International Master Dorsa Derakhshani described the show as ""very, very accurate"" and that she was surprised at ""how actually strong the games are"".Judit Polgár, who was the first woman to play for a world championship title, said that the show depicted the male players as ""too nice"", while Canadian chess streamer Andrea Botez also felt the show ""toned down"" the sexism in the chess world. Former British Women's champion Sarah Longson said Beth should have realistically lost more. Reigning chess world champion Magnus Carlsen gave it 5 out of 6 stars but found it ""a little too unrealistic"" for how quickly Beth developed her skills. Houska stated that she related to Beth being one of the few women in a tournament, and noted that sexism was worse at the ""hobby"" level, especially for young girls. In the final episode of the show, the women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili is mentioned as having ""never faced men"", despite the real-life Gaprindashvili frequently playing against male opponents, including top-level grandmasters. In response, Gaprindashvili said ""it's dishonouring to have misinformation spread about someone's achievements"" and described it as ""a shame, of course"". She noted that the show does portray the pressures of professional chess, stating, ""You have to be psychologically and physically strong, and have a drive for excellence.""

Section: Interest in chess (2):
In November 2020, The Washington Post reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had already increased the public's interest in chess, but the popularity of The Queen's Gambit made it explode. The New York Times compared the interest in chess to the ""similar chess mania"" after Bobby Fischer beat Boris Spassky to become world champion in 1972. According to The Guardian, grandmaster Maurice Ashley has been inundated by messages from people – mainly women – enthused by the series: ""the frenzy around it is crazy"". Sales of chess sets rose greatly following the release of the series, with U.S. company Goliath Games stating their chess set sales increased over a thousand percent due to the series, while marketing firm NPD Group found chess book sales had increased over 600 percent. Chess.com reports several million new users since the release of the series, with a higher rate of registrations by female players compared to before the series. Chess instructors have stated that the demand for chess lessons has significantly increased as well.

The four-part miniseries recounts the events and investigation surrounding the murders of 13 women that took place in West Yorkshire and Manchester between 1975 and 1980 by the serial killer Peter Sutcliffe. Dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper by the press, journalists were taken with the similarities to the murders conducted by the notorious Jack the Ripper and used the name to spark interest in the public. This series follows the chronology of events and is told through interviews with investigators, journalists, survivors and family members of victims.",,,"The Ripper, directed by Jesse Vile and Ellena Wood, is a four-episode docuseries about how a serial killer called The Yorkshire Ripper terrorized the County of York, in northern England, during the latter half of the 1970s. Between 1975 and 1980, Peter Sutcliffe murdered 13 women in and around the city of Leeds, and assaulted scores of others. But it took the police in Yorkshire years to capture him, due to a combination of his elusiveness, sexist assumptions about his victims by law enforcement, and a general feel that the entire department was disorganized.Opening Shot: A dark scene outside of low-slung apartment buildings in West Yorkshire, England. A man describes being awakened in the middle of the night by his sister when their mother didn’t come back from going out. He was 5 and she was 6.The Gist: The first episode talks about the first few murders, which took place either in the city of Leeds or the town of Bradford. The first victim, Wilma McCann, was found not far from her home; she had been bludgeoned with a hammer, then stabbed 15 times. Because she was out for the night, her four kids at home, near the city’s supposed red-light district, it was assumed by both the police and the local press that she was a prostitute. The same went for the next three victims.Vile and Wood talk to police investigators who were on the case as they pieced together that they had a serial killer on their hands; they came to the conclusion that this killer “hated prostitutes,” because that’s who he had killed to that point, not taking into account why these women were doing sex work to begin with. The fourth victim, Patricia Atkinson, was found in her Bradford flat, breaking the mold that the women would be killed in random spots. Then his fifth victim, a 16-year-old named Jayne MacDonald, was discovered, with all the earmarks of the killer that’s haunted Yorkshire for the prior two years.Christa Ackroyd, who was a young local reporter at the time, knew that the view of who murdered these women was colored by the idea that he killed random prostitutes, what she felt was a misogynistic view, unnecessarily informing women who “didn’t have many boyfriends that they were fine.” The discovery of MacDonald, who was most definitely not a prostitute, changed that notion, even though the male reporters and cops dismissed the pattern change as mistaken identity, that he thought that the girl was a prostitute.What Shows Will It Remind You Of? A whole segment of true-crime docuseries that tried to figure out the motivations of serial killers that attacked only women. It’s sort of like the killer-focused parts of I’ll Be Gone In The Dark.Our Take: What The Ripper strives to do is follow the long and winding path the West Yorkshire police took to find Sutcliffe; it eventually became one of England’s biggest manhunts as he went mostly around Yorkshire killing young and middle-aged women for five years. From the first episode, the filmmakers are setting up a story about how the area’s downturn following the departure of various industrial behemoths led to women needing to perform sex work to make ends meet, putting them in the path of Sutcliffe.That’s the angle that we find refreshing. As more than one of the male investigators and Christa Ackroyd said, describing these women as merely prostitutes minimized the murders in the public eye and gave the public a false sense of security. It also led the cops down paths that just ended up being dead ends. What we hope to see going forward is how law enforcement’s blinkered view of his victims, along with the constant reorganization among police leadership, led to Sutcliffe getting away with murder for a half-decade.Yes, we’ll get to see all the beats you usually see in true crime docuseries, including Sutcliffe’s trial. But it’s the issues in the background that allowed Sutcliffe to murder and attack people unchecked for years that will really be the interesting part of this series.Sex and Skin: Beyond showing archival footage of a topless stripper to talk about a local strip club, there isn’t anything.Parting Shot: A seeming break in the case — a young woman that survived Sutcliffe’s attack — is found.Sleeper Star: The archival footage that Vile and Wood were able to dig up — mostly from local news reports — shows how truly poor some of the areas in Yorkshire were in the ’70s, after its major industries left. Some of the footage equals or even surpasses some of the poverty we’ve seen in footage from major U.S. cities during the same time period.Most Pilot-y Line: It’s just amazing how these old White guy cops haven’t really changed their language about the people in Leeds’ red-light district (mostly Black) or the women that Sutcliffe killed, despite the fact that more than four decades have passed.Our Call: STREAM IT. Even though the case has been settled for almost 40 years — and Sutcliffe died in November — The Ripper is fascinating to us because it will examine the underlying factors that slowed down the investigation, instead of talking about the killer himself.",7.1,6634,Negative,0.575

But Generation, a HBO Max series created by writer-director Daniel Barnz (Phoebe in Wonderland, Cake) and his teenage daughter, Zelda, accentuates the comedy of teenage naivety, even as it seeks out the gaps in its young characters’ armor, sliding its skewers into their deepest wounds and vulnerabilities.The sense of humour is out there immediately with schoolgirl Naomi (Chloe East) sitting outside a shopping-mall toilet listening to her friend complaining about period cramps and then offering to slip oxycodone under the door for her to snort for pain relief – even as she’s texting another friend about how overly dramatic Unseen Toilet Friend is being. When Unseen Toilet Friend reveals that she might actually be in labour from an unsuspected pregnancy, things get a little weird, and then increasingly surreal as the scene goes on to fragment and form each episode – the events of which happened weeks earlier.Many of those earlier events revolve around Naomi and her brother and schoolmate, Nathan (Uly Schlesinger), who are as close as siblings can be – until Naomi learns that Nathan hasn’t confided in her that he’s bisexual. Nathan’s big crush is the flamboyant Chester (The Get Down’s Justice Smith), a youth who enjoys showing up to school in barely-there crop-tops in order to provoke conflicts with the teachers who have to enforce the school dress code. It goes without saying that absolutely everyone on screen has issues, not least Naomi’s and Nathan’s uptight mum, Megan (Martha Plimpton), who is soon rattling around in denial upon learning of Nathan’s bisexuality.And it’s in the relatively organic unpacking of those issues that Generation begins to show its heart, whether it be about the plight of young Greta (Haley Sanchez), whose mother has been deported to Mexico, or Arianna (Nathanya Alexander), whose issues with being the child of two gay dads sublimates into caustically homophobic remarks. There’s a lot of empathy there, not least when it comes to Plimpton’s character.Older viewers will be most struck by how hardened young people seem to have become to new things – such as sudden, unexplained school lockdowns brought on by false alarms about school shooters. Binge is premiering double episodes weekly.It’s a fascinating premise: a sudden technological cataclysm plunges the world into a new dark age, from which rises a new European patchwork of tribes, warlords and nascent proto-states. At the heart of the series are the gentle, technology-shunning, German-speaking Origines, who are about to meet a near-genocide that leaves a few survivors bent on vengeance. It’s all quite brilliantly imagined and handsomely rendered, with scenes of visceral hand-to-hand combat and torture that remind us that we’re really going backwards, but a dappling of light to keep us watching.Solar OppositesDisney+Disney+ has launched its new grown-ups channel, Star, with a small avalanche of adult-oriented TV series and movies that range from Australian premieres (most of them originally made for Hulu) to recent hits and older genre classics such as Alien and Conan the Barbarian. One of the most fun is the distinctly adults-only animation Solar Opposites, from Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland. Two refugee aliens, their juvenile “replicants” and a cannibalistic Maggie Simpson-like pupa live in a regular suburb with amusing and frequently gory results.Snapped: Behind BarsHayunapped (also on Hayu) is a pretty standard true-crime series. Snapped: Behind Bars is more compelling because it features interviews with the murderers responsible for some of the killings covered in Snapped. Don’t expect simple resolution, though. The first episode is built around an interview with American Sabrina Zunich, who is serving 30 years to life for stabbing her foster mother to death. Zunich’s court testimony resulted in her foster father being convicted for sexually abusing her and inciting the murder, but the producers here enlist people to call her a liar.The WatchStanLovers of Terry Pratchett’s hilarious Discworld novels will have been concerned to see this BBC America adaptation of The Watch looking more modern than medieval in its grimy setting and wardrobe.Fear not. While Pratchett’s storied city of Ankh-Morpork does indeed look as though some of the scuzziest bits of the 20th century just crashed into it, the City Watch’s Sergeant Detritus (Ralph Ineson) is still a towering, stony rock troll; Corporal Angua (Marama Corlett) is still a sullen werewolf and Constable Carrot (Adam Hugill) is still a towering, idealistic young human who was raised by dwarves to think he is a dwarf.Best of all, watch captain Sam Vimes is played by Richard Dormer as a perfectly jaded yet twitchy veteran who sings in his drunken slumbers, who still kicks against the pricks of his own conscience, and who always has a burned-out cheroot stuck between his teeth or behind his ear.Plot? Sure, there’s all kinds of skulduggery and even a dragon, but the setting and characters prove the greater gift. One for Pratchett fans and newcomers alike.SpycraftNetflixThe audacity and ingenuity with which world powers have been spying on each other almost beggars belief. If you’re amazed at the way the Czechoslovakian intelligence service was able to get a bug into the heel of an American ambassador’s shoe in the 1970s you’ll be stunned by the way the Soviets were able to put analog keyloggers in the typewriters in the US embassy in Moscow.

The first episode received favorable reviews, with an average rating of 71% according to Metacritic. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised the casting, notably of Fimmel as Ragnar, and observed that Vikings ""isn't complicated. It ... relies on the inherent appeal of the era and these characters to drive the story"".  Nancy DeWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal noted the ""natural and authentic"" setting and costumes, and appreciated that Vikings was (unlike, for example, Spartacus) not a celebration of sex and violence, but ""a study of character, stamina, power and ... of social, emotional and even intellectual awakening"". Hank Stuever, writing for The Washington Post, said that the ""compelling and robust new drama series ... delivers all the expected gore and blood spatter"", but that it successfully adapted the skills of cable television drama, with the care taken in acting, writing and sense of scope reminiscent of Rome, Sons of Anarchy and Game of Thrones. He also suggested that the way the series emphasized ""a core pride and nobility in this tribe of thugs"" reflected ""just another iteration of Tony Soprano"". Neil Genzlinger, in The New York Times, praised the ""arresting"" cinematography and the actors' performances, notably Fimmel's, and favorably contrasted Vikings to Game of Thrones and Spartacus for the absence of gratuitous nudity.In TIME, James Poniewozik noted that the relatively simple generational conflict underlying Vikings ""doesn't nearly have the narrative ambition of a Game of Thrones or the political subtleties of a Rome"", nor these series' skill with dialogue, but that it held up pretty well compared to the ""tabloid history"" of The Tudors and The Borgias. He concluded that ""Vikings' larger story arc is really more about historical forces"" than about its not very complex characters. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly appreciated the performances, but considered Vikings to be ""kind of a mess"", lacking the intrigue of The Tudors and Game of Thrones. Brian Lowry criticized the series in Variety as an ""unrelenting cheese-fest"" and as a ""more simpleminded version of Game of Thrones"", but considered that it had ""a level of atmosphere and momentum that makes it work as a mild diversion"". In the San Francisco Chronicle, David Wiegand was disappointed by the series' ""glacial pace"" and lack of action as well as the ""flabby direction and a gassy script"", while appreciating the performances and characters.The second season received a Metacritic rating of 77%, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 92% based on twelve professional critic reviews.

Section: Historical inaccuracies (2):
Some critics have cited historical inaccuracies in the depiction of Viking society. Lars Walker, in the magazine The American Spectator, criticised its portrayal of early Viking Age government (represented by Earl Haraldson) as autocratic rather than essentially democratic. Joel Robert Thompson criticised depiction of the Scandinavians' supposed ignorance of the existence of Britain and Ireland and of the death penalty rather than outlawry (skoggangr) as their most serious punishment.Monty Dobson, a historian at Central Michigan University, criticised the depiction of Viking clothing but went on to say that fictional shows like Vikings could still be a useful teaching tool. The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten reported that the series incorrectly depicted the temple at Uppsala as a stave church in the mountains, whereas the historical temple was situated on flat land and stave churches were characteristic of later Christian architecture. The temple in the series has similarities with reconstructions of the Uppåkra hof.
Many characters are based on (or inspired by) real people from history or legend and the events portrayed are broadly drawn from history. The history of more than a century has been condensed; people who could never have met are shown as of similar age, with the history amended for dramatic effect. Season one leads up to the attack on Lindisfarne Abbey of 793 (before the real Rollo was born). In season three the same characters at roughly the same ages participate in the Siege of Paris of 845. Ecbert was dead and King Alfred the Great was already on the throne, yet he is portrayed as a child in season four. Rollo is shown having his followers killed and fighting his fellow Vikings, whereas in history they were granted what became Normandy and continued to co-operate with their Norse kinsmen.
Little is known about Viking religious practice and its depiction is largely fictitious. When Katheryn Winnick was asked why she licked the seer's hand she answered: ""It wasn't originally in the script and we just wanted to come up with something unique and different"". The showrunner Michael Hirst said, ""I especially had to take liberties with Vikings because no one knows for sure what happened in the Dark Ages ... we want people to watch it. A historical account of the Vikings would reach hundreds, occasionally thousands, of people. Here we've got to reach millions"".The depiction of Christianity in the show is also somewhat controversial. In the fourth episode of the second season, the bishop of Wessex is shown inflicting crucifixion as punishment for apostasy, while it had been outlawed more than four centuries earlier by Emperor Constantine the Great, and it would have been blasphemous for the Christian population.
Athelstan is portrayed being heroic but an unfavourable attitude towards Christianity is implied from the narrative choices in the depiction of figures venerated as Saints by the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, such as Heahmund the Bishop of Sherborne (who is portrayed as having a deeply questionable morality, being involved in several sexual relations and in the murder of another bishop) and the Missionary Ansgar, the Patron of Scandinavia (his death is inaccurately depicted as taking place in Scandinavia, and no mention is made of his effective evangelisation).

64,Who Killed Sara?,Mexico,Perro Azul,Netflix,,José Ignacio Valenzuela,40,"Thriller,Mystery,Melodrama",1,10,Who Killed Sara? (Spanish: ¿Quién mató a Sara?) is a Mexican thriller streaming television series created by José Ignacio Valenzuela and produced by Perro Azul for Netflix. The first season was released by the latter platform in March 2021.,,,"The Spanish language show, created by prolific Chilean writer José Ignacio Valenzuela, is a passable revenge thriller with barely enough to set it apart from the rest. The show’s premise is simple: Alex Guzmán (the quiet, furious Manolo Cardona) is released from prison after having been wrongfully incarcerated for 18 years, having taken the fall for the suspicious death of his sister, Sara. Now, he’s hell-bent on uncovering the actual murderer and serving them a healthy dose of justice, no matter the cost. Yeah, it’s not a very original premise. And the show doesn’t do much with it either. However, Netflix knows that there’s nothing more compelling than murder, especially when you throw in an extravagantly rich and powerful family. In this case, it’s the Lazcano crime family, headed by César Lazcano (an appropriately menacing Ginés García Millán). Sara, at the time of her death, is dating Rodolfo Lazcano, and the two of them, along with her brother Alex and other members of the Lazcano family, are partying away on a boat. As Alex dives deep into their darker secrets, the show proceeds to point fingers towards one suspect after the other, serving up enough red herrings for a feast. To be fair, there’s enough drama and intrigue on offer to keep you watching if this sounds like your type of thing. But when compared to other, recent works, which operate in a similar territory of murky, powerful families and covered up murders, like Succession or Knives Out, it falls painfully short of the mark. Whereas these other works can usually mine something deeper out of their narratives, Who Killed Sara? feels like a cobbling together of many, half-fascinating tropes that don’t do much more than serve a surface-level intrigue. There is a case to be made for the value of a murder-mystery pumped with melodrama, which fuses telenovella trappings with a contemporary, pretty Netflix series. Yet again, it’s other shows which play with this idea that bring out the deficiencies in this one– if they weren’t apparent otherwise. I may not be a huge fan of the uber popular La Casa De Papel (awkwardly titled Money Heist in English), but what I still find remarkable about the show is its deft balance of fast plotting, well-channelled melodrama, and distinctive characters. Unfortunately, Who Killed Sara? has none of these qualities. At the very least, once it gets going, it does keep up the pace, which helps get through most of it. But the length of the show isn’t the real issue. It’s the characters. As it is with shows, the sheer investment of time we put into them, makes us care a little about the characters anyway. Just a little bit of effort, though, to make sure that there’s actual reason, or emotion, compelling us to care, would have gone a long way. For some reason, this continues a trend of Netflix shows finding it harder and harder to write interesting, charismatic people. Alex is a boring, generically vengeful, cishet white dude. It should be clear that this is not a fault of the actor playing him, and neither does this mean that you can’t write great, revenge stories about white people. There’s just such a little sense of who he is, and even worse, we barely get any idea of the impact of the years he’s wrongfully spent in prison. This leads into another issue. When La Casa De Papel requires some suspension of disbelief, it is never intrusive. On Who Killed Sara?, one must actively resist thinking about the mechanics of the show. I find ‘plotholes’ to be a very reductive way of looking at film or television, but when we have such little sense of a character’s past, their weaknesses, and their suffering (which, specifically, seems to be important to the premise of the show), then it no longer becomes just about a boring character, it’s just a badly written story.",6.7,1064,Positive,0.934

The premise revolves around making key decisions to help Bear Grylls navigate in harsh, scary environments to survive and complete missions. Grylls speaks directly to the camera, asking the viewer to select between options like scaling a cliff or scrambling along the coastline, etc.The full season of You vs. Wild consisting of eight episodes has been released on April 10, 2019.
Later on, on February 16, 2021, the movie ""Animals on the Loose: A You vs. Wild Movie"" was released on Netflix",,,"t seems like we’re getting a fair amount of stories that involve some sort of inappropriate teacher-student relationship. Some are dealt with quietly, like A Teacher, others have it as part of a larger story (Tiny Pretty Things). But The Mess You Leave Behind, a new Spanish thriller on Netflix, takes this topic and makes it even more foreboding than the other shows do. Read on for more.Opening Shot: A woman is looking at her laptop, when she is startled by her doorbell buzzing and someone knocking. Then, as she copies files to a flash drive, the person tries to get in with his keys.The Gist: The woman knows the person trying to get in; it’s her ex-husband, who is concerned for her safety. She doesn’t let him in, saying “I’m this close to giving up on this shit.”We’re then introduced to a young teacher named Raquel (Inma Cuesta), who dreams that she comes home from shopping just to be told by her husband Germán (Tomar Novas) that her mother, whom she’s been caring for, has passed. But it’s actually a few months later, though her mom’s death still haunts her. She gets a job as a substitute teacher in the village of Galicia; she’ll be taking over a high school literature class from a departed teacher. She and Germán think of it as a fresh start, though he has to deal with living with his newly-widowed mother in the village. Raquel is also dismayed by her husband’s habit of doing blow.Then we see the woman from the first scene, Viruca (Bárbara Lennie), giving a class at the same school a surprise essay-based test about a Sylvia Plath poem about suicide. There’s something going on between her and one of her students, Iago (Arón Piper), but it’s hard to know what. What we do know is that Iago and his girlfriend Nerea (Isabel Garrido) have broken up because of it. Nerea’s essay directly threatens Viruca. Her ex-husband Mauro (Roberto Enríquez) also works at the school.Raquel comes in a day early to get the lay of the land before her first class. She runs into Iago and his buddy Roi (Roque Ruíz) getting into a minor scuffle, and when she confronts them, he tries to scare her off. She also sees Nerea debate about the patriarchy in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Later that day, when she takes her dog for a walk at the hot springs, she sees Roi taking pictures of Iago holding a gun while both are in the warm pools, wearing nothing but skivvies. Iago takes his undies off and Raquel says, “You’re just a kid trying to impress a grown-up woman, and it’s not going to work.”Viruca becomes increasingly unhinged, and we learn pretty quickly that she and Iago had an affair that led to the breakup of her marriage. He confronts her in a staff restroom, and Roi follows him in; Iago is torn to pieces by the hell she’s put him through.On Raquel’s first day of class, she is not only rebuffed by the likes of Iago and Nerea, but right before she enters class she finds out that the teacher she’s replacing committed suicide three weeks prior. Yes, that’s right: She’s Viruca’s replacement.What Shows Will It Remind You Of? This is sort of like A Teacher, but with a more thriller-type of vibe.Our Take: Created by Carlos Montero, The Mess You Leave Behind (Original title: El desorden que dejas) is based on the novel of the same name, and its storytelling technique is either going to be a creative way to tell both Viruca’s and Raquel’s stories or it’s going to be completely distracting. Judging by the first episode, we’re going to go with the former.Montero and his writers did do a good job of seamlessly going back and for between the two timeliness; at some point, viewers are likely to figure out the surprise before it’s actually revealed, but we don’t hold that against the show, because they’re not using this storytelling method as a gimmick; it’s baked into the entire series, to show how Viruca and Iago fell into this forbidden relationship and how Raquel is going to try to pick up the pieces.There’s obviously more to this story that we’re not privy to just yet; for instance, Raquel keeps having vivid dreams involving her mother, who was a doctor when she was alive and healthy. She also seems to have other visions, as you’ll see below. There is something about the school, or the town, that makes people like Viruca bored, or paranoid or both. When she’s grading the test she gives her class on her first day, Raquel comes across Viruca’s “MISSING” poster with the words “How long before you die, too?” scrawled on the back. So there’s a chance Viruca’s death wasn’t a suicide.We’ll be spending the remainder of the 8-episode season examining Viruca’s story and how it affects Raquel. Given how smoothly the first episode went, and the strong performances from both Cuesta as Raquel and Lennie as Viruca, there’s a good chance that these stories will continue to interact seamlessly with each other.Sex and Skin: After encountering Iago and Roi at the hot springs, Raquel has sex with Germán for the first time in a long time. He’s a little rusty. Might be the coke. Anyway, she may be turned on by the fact that he’s a man and Iago is just a silly kid, or she really get turned on by the sight of Iago’s manhood.Parting Shot: After her rough first day, Raquel takes a bottle of wine and gets in a steaming hot bath. She envisions a bruised Viruca in the bath with her, then wakes up. Will her visions switch from her mom to Viruca?Sleeper Star: We’re intrigued by how Roi, played by Roque Ruíz, factors into all of this. He found Viruca’s body and he was very emotional as he tried to revive her. Yet, at the hot springs, he was very intrigued by getting into his skivvies with Iago. So in the Viruca-Iago relationship, who was he jealous of? Or was there  more going on?Most Pilot-y Line: In one of Raquel’s dreams, she sees her mother, dressed in a doctor’s lab coat and scrubs. On one hand, the mom says “I’m not even cold yet and you move?” Then, when Raquel says, “You’re dead,” her mother insists she’s not. When she goes to listen to her own heartbeat, she can’t find it, which is when Raquel wakes up. Look, we know dreams can be weird, but this one didn’t make any sense.Our Call: STREAM IT. The fact that we’re not turned off by the two-timeline storytelling technique of The Mess You Leave Behind is a testament to how well the timelines are stitched together. As the season goes along, we hope that the stories continue to be as smoothly told, especially as they wind together.",6.7,2204,Negative,0.515

Producers of Zero Chill wanted to cast real skaters for the series, since it brought ""authenticity"" that ""CGI trickery"" could not. Regardless of their skating experience, the cast members were sent to a nine-week training programme prior to filming. Executive producer Angelo Abela stated that the cast members got to try out both sports, so ice skaters could play ice hockey and vice versa. Dakota Benjamin Taylor explained that for the ice skating scenes, cast members were not permitted to do jumps on the ice. After producers met with Team GB figure skating coach David Hartley, the general manager of the IceSheffield, where Hartley works, offered them the opportunity to film the series there. When the cast members went in for training, they were able to watch professional figure skaters training, as well as the Sheffield Steelers.Abela stated that they used filming techniques that were used on Free Rein, another series produced by Lime Pictures. He explained: ""We decided to shoot in two different ways: with the figure skaters we went for very elegant, long tracking shots on the ice. We put cameramen in rickshaws and had them pushed on the ice alongside the skaters. Then, with the hockey scenes, it became much more handheld camera work, filmed behind Perspex screens on the ice."" On the choice to film the series in Sheffield, Abala explained that the city is known as a ""major ice-skating hub"". Other filming locations include Park Hill, Broomhall, Sheaf Valley Park, the Cholera Monument Grounds and Norfolk Heritage Park. Hartley and two members of the Sheffield Steelers were also hired as coaches for the cast members.

","Have you ever heard of England described as a hotbed of hockey? Us neither. But apparently players will move from Canada to go to academies there, or at least that happens in the world of the new Netflix family series Zero Chill. So sit back and suspend all logic and disbelief and watch some interesting family drama… on ice!Opening Shot: A teenage girl sets up flashlights around the surface of a skating rink and waits for her friend to FaceTime her.The Gist: Kayla MacBentley (Grace Beedie) is a talented 15-year-old figure skater, but has been out of sorts since her family moved from Canada to England, so her twin brother Mac (Dakota Taylor) can hone his talents at a prestigious hockey academy run by Anton Hammarström (Oscar Skagerberg), a former NHL superstar and teammate of their father Luke (Doug Rao).She does these transatlantic practice sessions with her best friend and skating partner Jacob Schimmer (Kenneth Tynan), sneaking out of her new house and sneaking into the rink where the Hammarström team plays. But she is still frustrated and resentful that her father and mother Jenny (Sarah-Jane Potts) tore her out of her comfort zone in order to move for Mac’s hockey career.For his part, Mac his having a little discomfort fitting into the flow of the team. He knows he’s the best on the talented squad, and he won’t let everyone on the team forget it. The team captain, Bear Seltzer (Jeremias Amoore), is trying everything to keep the other players from alienating Mac, but Mac is not making it easy.After Jacob tells Kayla that he can’t keep doing these FaceTime practices anymore, Kayla becomes even more disgruntled at the move. Her fit of pique is alleviated a little bit when she meets and becomes fast friends with Sky Tyler (Jade Ma) who works at the rink’s cafe, which is owned by her mother Holly (Christina Tam). But Sky is holding a secret, about both her health and her skating ability, that will definitely affect their new friendship.As Kayla practices in the rink, she sees a mysterious skater, dressed in full hockey gear, whose identity she desperately wants to find out, because that skater is pretty darn talented and they skate well together the only time they get a chance.Our Take: One of the things that made us scratch our heads about Zero Chill, created by Kirstie Falkous and John Regier, is that the MacBentley’s moved away from Canada, the hockey capital of the world, to England, a country that has little to no hockey heritage, in order for Mac to further his hockey career? It seems counterintuitive, especially because Mac is as talented as he supposedly is. It feels like a bit of a complicated setup, all things considered, a way to get Kayla as far away from home as possible but make sure everyone there still realistically speaks English. It took a good 5 or so minutes to wrap our minds around this reverse migration, especially because Kayla and Mac’s mother is English herself.Once you get past the strange setup, though, Zero Chill is a pretty harmless family show. Do the MacBentley twins show a bit of a privileged personality? Absolutely. If the worst that can happen to Kayla is that she lost her skating partner, so be it. And Mac is so arrogant that he cares less about his sister’s skating career than it seems her parents do.That kind of stuff feels minor compared to Falkous’ and Reiger’s ability to flesh out their characters pretty quickly. For instance, just having Sky draw a mustache on her face because she sees the annoyed Kayla doing it, leading to their fast friendship, was a cute way to introduce her as a character and says a lot about the kind of person she is. It’s a show, don’t tell moment that incorporates all sorts of exposition into one quick move.The other characters need a little more depth, but at least the parents are written as real people and not just humiliation machines for their teenage kids.What Age Group Is This For?: The show is rated TV-G, and any skating-loving kid 6 and up would enjoy it.Parting Shot: After skating with the mystery skater, Kayla asks the skater to take off his/her mask. The skater is about to when Anton (called to the arena by Kayla’s snitching brother) calls out to her. By the time she turns back from Anton, the mystery skater is gone.Sleeper Star: Tanja Ribic and Anastázie Chocholatá play Anton’s wife Elina and daughter Ava, respectively. They don’t get a ton of time in the first episode, but it seems that they both resent how the talented Ava isn’t getting a second look from her father, despite her figure skating ability.Most Pilot-y Line: Kayla’s mom finds her a potential skating partner that is not only three inches shorter than he is, but he drops people and can’t even really do any of the moves. He has a killer outfit, though. A bit of slapsticky comic relief for an otherwise grounded show.Our Call: STREAM IT. Zero Chill is nothing fancy or revolutionary. But it’s 35 minutes of harmless family fun, as long as you don’t start thinking about the logic of the show too hard.",5.6,630,Negative,0.701

The series premiered on March 17, 2015, and ran for five seasons, ending on August 1, 2019. It follows the adventures of a doctor-turned-zombie named Olivia ""Liv"" Moore (Rose McIver), a Seattle Police medical examiner who helps solve murders after eating the victims' brains and temporarily inheriting their memories and personalities.","Section: Cast and characters (1):
Rose McIver as Olivia ""Liv"" Moore: A former medical resident who became a zombie when she attended a boat party that was attacked by people who had just taken a new designer drug called ""Utopium"" while also consuming the Max Rager energy drink. She works as a coroner's assistant for the King County Medical Examiner's Office to have access to the human brains she must frequently consume to maintain her humanity and suppress her hunger. She experiences flashes of memories from the brains she eats, and temporarily takes on random quirks from her subjects and has demonstrated the ability to take a bullet to the chest with little damage. Through her visions, Liv uses her powers to bring justice to the victims and help Seattle Police find and apprehend murderers. In season four she assumes the alias ""Renegade"", eventually becoming a public figure as she seeks to aid other zombies by smuggling them in and out of the city.
Malcolm Goodwin as Clive Babineaux: A Seattle PD detective, newly transferred from vice to homicide when the series starts, who gets Liv's help to solve crimes. Liv and Ravi initially claim that she is ""psychic-ish"" to account for her knowledge of victims, but he eventually learns the truth about her in the second season. With her help, Clive has solved many cases in an incredibly efficient and accurate fashion, hoping one day to be promoted to Captain. He is in a relationship with former federal agent-turned cop Dale Bozzio.
Rahul Kohli as Ravi Chakrabarti: A medical examiner, Liv's friend, and Major's eventual roommate. He knows Liv's secret and assists her whenever he can to protect as well as study her, expressing an interest in finding a cure for her condition. He used to work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but was fired for his obsession with preparing for an attack with biological weapons. In season 4, he becomes a half zombie while experimenting on himself to develop a zombie vaccine.
Robert Buckley as Major Lilywhite: Liv's ex-fiancé, with whom she ended the relationship to prevent him from becoming ""infected"" by her condition. He worked as a social worker at the local teen center, Helton Shelter, in the first season. In the second season he was blackmailed into working for Max Rager, and he works for Fillmore-Graves in the third and fourth seasons. In the fourth season finale, he becomes the commander of the organization after the death of his predecessor, Chase Graves.
David Anders as Blaine ""DeBeers"" McDonough: A drug dealer-turned brain-dealing zombie who dealt a tainted version of the experimental drug, Utopium, which helped cause the zombie outbreak. Despite being a career criminal and often serving as an antagonist, he is offered a pardon in the fourth season finale and the chance to be a hero by smuggling and supplying brains after the government cuts off shipments. This leads to him becoming a celebrity in the fifth season, though he still resorts to criminal activity to ensure the brain supply, and to that end, his status. Eventually he is exposed as part of a plot by Stacey Boss, and after losing everything becomes more evil than ever in an attempt to regain his lifestyle. Show co-creator Diane Ruggiero-Wright stated prior to the series finale that there were once plans to redeem the character, who acted as the series’ wild card, but they ultimately fell through.
Aly Michalka as Peyton Charles: Liv's best friend and roommate, who expresses concern about Liv's declining interest in life after the boat party. She also works as an assistant district attorney for the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, before becoming the Mayor's Chief of Staff at the end of the third season. Following the Mayor's death, she becomes the acting Mayor with the goal of improving relations between Seattle's zombies and humans. Alexandra Krosney played the part of Peyton Charles in the original unaired pilot. (season 3–5; recurring seasons 1–2)
Robert Knepper as Angus McDonough: Blaine's estranged and abusive father whom he turned into a zombie, and who tried to force Blaine to work for him prior to becoming one of Major's Chaos Killer victims. When the character returns as a regular in the fourth season, he becomes a religious cult leader known as ""Brother Love"", preaching pro-zombie/anti-human sentiment. Angus is ultimately executed by the United States military after trying to escape the city while leading a mass breakout of his followers. Though he attempted to mend his relationship with his son, it deteriorates immediately prior to his death upon discovering Blaine manipulated and used his cult for his own ends. (season 4; recurring seasons 2–3)
Bryce Hodgson as Donald ""Don E."" Eberhard: An associate of Blaine who becomes his henchman, and later business partner. Hodgson also played the character's twin brother Scott E., a mental patient who believes in zombies, in two episodes of the first season and a flashback in the final season.
