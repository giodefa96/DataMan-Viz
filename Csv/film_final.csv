It is based on the first novel of a trilogy by Blanka Lipińska. The plot follows a young woman from Warsaw in a spiritless relationship falling for a dominant Sicilian man, who imprisons and imposes on her a period of 365 days for which to fall in love with him. It stars Michele Morrone as Don Massimo Torricelli and Anna-Maria Sieklucka as Laura Biel. 
The film was released theatrically in Poland on 7 February 2020 and was later made available on Netflix on 7 June 2020, quickly gaining global attention. It was one of the most watched items in numerous territories on multiple continents, and had one of the longest periods as the most watched item in Netflix's history in the United States. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, who heavily criticized its softcore themes and sexual violence.","Section: Plot (1):
After a meeting between the Torricelli Sicilian Mafia crime family and black market dealers, Massimo Torricelli watches a beautiful woman on a beach. Then, Massimo and his father, leader of the Sicilian Mafia family, were both shot by the dealers; Massimo survives while his father dies from his injuries.
Five years later, Massimo is now the leader of the Torricelli crime family. In Warsaw, Laura Biel, a fiery executive, is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Martin. Laura celebrates her 29th birthday in Italy but after Martin embarrasses her, she goes for a walk and runs into Massimo, who kidnaps her.
At his villa, Massimo reveals to Laura that she was the woman at the beach five years ago and that when he was injured, all he could think about was her. After searching for years and finally spotting her, he had to have her and intends to keep her as a prisoner for 365 days until she falls in love with him. He also promises her that he will not touch her without her consent, whilst simultaneously having his hands around her throat and touching her. When she tries to escape, he does not let her leave.
As they spend time together, Laura teases him and then refuses to have sex with him. However, she slowly starts to get him to open up about his personal life. At a hotel in Rome, she teases him again and he cuffs her to the bed. She is forced to watch Massimo receive oral sex from another woman. Afterward, she appears to want to give in. However, he stops, releases her, and orders her to get dressed for a club.
At the club, Laura flaunts herself for Massimo and his friends, angering him. When she begins to flirt with a man from the rival mafia family, the man gropes her against her will. Massimo and the others draw their weapons while Laura is taken out of the club. The following morning, she awakens on a yacht to Massimo and his fellow mafioso, Mario, arguing. During the night, Massimo shot the man's hand who had groped Laura, inciting a mafia war between the two families. Laura attempts to apologize, but Massimo blames her for the incident. As they argue, Laura falls into the water and starts to panic. Massimo jumps in to save her. When she awakens, he admits he was scared she might not make it and does not want to lose her, taking advantage of her emotional state to have sex with her.
Massimo allows Laura to visit her family in Warsaw. He tells her he loves her and will join her after finishing up business. In Warsaw, Laura waits for Massimo for days with no contact. She reconnects with Olga and they go clubbing. She runs into Martin, who says he has been looking for her to apologize. He attempts to convince her to reconcile and follows her back to her apartment, where Massimo is unexpectedly waiting. While having sex, she opens his shirt to see wounds from the mafia war. She confesses to him that she loves him. The following morning, Massimo proposes and she accepts. However, she asks him to keep his ""occupation"" a secret from her parents.
Back in Italy, Mario informs Massimo of rising tensions. Laura mentions feeling unwell but brushes off seeing a doctor. They discuss their upcoming wedding that her family is not allowed to attend, as she does not want them to discover what Massimo does. However, Massimo allows Olga to come as Laura's bridesmaid. When Olga visits, Laura reveals she is pregnant. Olga urges her to tell Massimo about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Mario receives a phone call from a Torricelli informant that the rival mafia family is about to kill Laura. Laura's car enters a tunnel but does not come out the other side. Mario rushes to find Massimo just as Laura's call drops. Realizing the implications, Massimo breaks down, as a police car blocks the entrance of the tunnel.

",,"Style outpaces substance enjoyably in 5 Is The Perfect Number (5 è il numero perfetto), a superficial but entertaining comic-book noir. As a melancholy retired hitman seeking vengeance for his son’s murder, Toni Servillo lends gravitas to this familiar crime saga, imbuing the character’s every action with an air of doomed grandeur. Adapting his own graphic novel, artist and illustrator Igort shows a strong sense of atmosphere and tone, resulting in a movie drunk on pulp pleasures. And although 5 doesn’t have anything new to say about family, regret or moral ambiguity, it moves confidently from one handsome set piece to the next. Screening in Venice Days, the film is set to open in Italy today, although genre aficionados the world over may enjoy this pungent, violent excursion. Co-starring Valeria Golino and Carlo Buccirosso, 5 shares a passing resemblance to other hardboiled neo-noirs like Sin City, which will give it cult appeal even if critical acclaim is moderate.

The film introduces us to grief-stricken Peppino (Servillo), who lives in Naples in the early 1970s. He is still pained by the recent loss of his beloved wife when his son Nino (Lorenzo Lancellotti), a hitman for the same crime family as he was years earlier, goes out on an assignment, only to be ambushed and shot dead. Teaming up with his old associate Totò (Buccirosso) and an enigmatic beauty, Rita (Golino), who carries a torch for him, Peppino sets out to determine whether someone in the syndicate orchestrated this killing.

Making his directorial debut, Igort works closely with cinematographer Nicolaj Brüel to construct a Naples of dreams: with its chiaroscuro lighting and silky interiors, 5 fashions a vivid, hyper-real world heavily indebted to previous noirs. Sporting a fake, beak-like nose and sad eyes, Servillo seems to have stepped out of a graphic novel, the understated intensity of Peppino’s emotions complemented by his striking, nearly cartoonish look.

5’s plot machinations aren’t particularly interesting, mostly serving as a way for us to see how this no-honour-among-thieves revenge tale will play out. But just as Servillo capably communicates the accumulated burden of all the killing that Peppino has meted out, so too do Buccirosso and Golino convincingly portray genre types. That said, it’s unfortunate that Golino is mostly asked to play the umpteenth version of the mysterious noir bombshell — Rita’s main quality is her ability to pine for this withdrawn man while batting her smoky eyes.

Still, Igort has a blast in his particular cinematic sandbox, touching on everything from spaghetti westerns to B-movies as he follows Peppino’s journey to learn the truth. Shootouts come in different varieties, all of them skilfully executed, and even when 5 slows down to pay lip-service to the psychic toll that crime takes on its practitioners, the quality of the performances ennobles what’s least-persuasive and compelling about the material. In a sense, the film is about Peppino’s realisation that he can, at least, maybe leave this life behind, but Igort has no intention of breaking from the rich, well-trod tradition of moody, stylized thrillers that 5 unapologetically swears an oath to.",5.3,1075,"Crime,Drama,Thriller",Positive,0.888

Joseph Van Aston lives a carefree life and is the son of a wealthy San Francisco real estate tycoon (his mom). He spends his time womanizing and enjoying his rich lifestyle. His mom sends him to Petaluma to close a deal to buy a dairy farm that has continuously refused a buyout to purchase the land. Callie Bernet is a hardworking and headstrong woman, whose farm is more valuable to her than any monetary value, despite being way behind on bills. She lives on the ranch with her mother Wendy, who has cancer, and her little sister Hannah. 
Joseph arrives at the farm and meets Callie, who is busy with a cow giving birth to a calf. He is mistaken for the new ranch hand Manny who is set to arrive soon, and assists Callie with the birth. He decides to take advantage of this in an attempt to gain Callie's trust, and despite no experience on a farm, continues to pose as Manny. 
Meanwhile, Joseph sends his butler Leo to find the real Manny and pay him to not show up at the farm. Manny capitalizes on the situation by making lavish requests in return for his silence. Manny stays at an Airbnb with Leo, where they pamper themselves, play video games, and drink fine wine throughout the day. Leo finds that Manny has an uncanny ability to determine every note in the wines. Manny also provides farming advice to Joseph, who is in over his head.
Over time Joseph becomes more adept on the farm and grows closer to the Bernet family. Joseph and Callie soon develop feelings for each other and Callie shows Joseph a small abandoned vineyard on the property—left behind by Callie’s late father. She occasionally gifts (but does not sell) the previously bottled wine, and they end up sharing part of a bottle. 
As Christmas approaches, Joseph attempts to tell Callie the truth about who he is, but never finds the right moment. He also continually ignores his mother's calls for a status update on the ranch deal. Joseph’s mother takes matters into her own hands and comes to the ranch, fully exposing the con, and pressures Callie to accept the deal to pay off her mother's extensive medical bills. Callie refuses the offer and kicks out Joseph, though Joseph stands up to his mother and pleads to help save the ranch.
Leo and Manny taste the wine from the ranch from the leftover bottle Joseph had and realize it's one of the best wines they've ever tasted. The three of them bring the wine to a prominent wine expert and the wine expert agrees on the quality. Joseph goes back to the abandoned vineyard on his own and helps spruce up the area. Callie finds him working on the vineyard and although still angry at him, works with him to make the vineyard presentable. The wine expert visits the vineyard and ends up purchasing the remainder of Callie's father's wine in the cellar and also leases the existing vines for the future. With the purchase and future commissions from sales, it is enough to keep the ranch in Callie's hands. 
Joseph secretly fixes up Callie's old barn and a Christmas / saving the ranch celebration takes place, where Callie eventually forgives him and they reconcile. Sometime in the future, Joseph and Callie are sitting on a bench in the now thriving vineyard. Wedding rings are visible on their hands.

",,"Callie and Joseph, the reel life lovers in A California Christmas are played by real life lovers, the married couple, Lorynn Swickard and Josh Swickard. The first we see of Josh Swickard are his rather skeletal toes, before we are introduced to the casanova caricature in one fell swoop, with legacy money running through his veins, and his vanity. 


Joseph is sent by his mother, a real estate baroness, on an assignment to the Californian vineyards to convince Callie, an obstinate debt ridden ranch owner, to sell her property. When Callie and Joseph first meet, she mistakes him for a ranch-hand, and Joseph keeps the charade hoping to charm her into the sale, but instead gets charmed himself- by a new way of life, and a new way to love, and be loved. 

The tropes are in lock-step with the caricature. Callie is strong-headed but weak-hearted, and follows in the vein of most inadequately sketched movies, where the only way to show that she is sensitive is to have her parents dead (father) or dying (mother). 

Perhaps the distinctiveness of this film is the imposition of Christmas- the deadline by which Joseph needs to make the sale. This is a bit odd because it never snows here in wine country California, so the snow is axed for languorous sun. To “save Christmas” becomes an act of saving Joseph’s inheritance- his job which he isn’t good at- his own mother tells him that his only strength is his capacity to charm (read: sleep with) women. He is charming in that cavalier way, a shadow of Scott Eastwood can be seen, but really, watching him milk cows and fix engines shirtless is barely more satisfying than scrolling through a well-curated Instagram feed of unveiled abs and veiled personality. 

The film’s journey hits the familiar rocks– Callie will find out the truth, feel betrayed, Joseph will overcompensate, and there’s that. This progression is so well-etched, I wonder if characters in a rom-com are aware of the rom-com trope, where a lover lies, but not to hurt, at least not initially. 

This goes to say that there is something radically ordinary about this movie- the hotness is adequate, the storytelling is adequate, the sex is adequate, the humour is adequate. Nothing to remember having watched it, and nothing to remember having enjoyed it even. ",5.7,6543,"Comedy,Drama,Romance",Positive,0.651

It was released in the United States on January 11, 2019, to mixed reviews from critics and grossed $80 million worldwide.","Section: Plot (1):
Lucas Ray and his friend Olivia, two residents of Denver, Colorado, find a puppy in a construction site along with many kittens and a mother cat. He names the dog Bella and takes her home to live with him and his mother, Terri Ray. Over the years, Lucas plays with and takes care of Bella. However, Lucas also continues to feed the cats at the old house, putting himself in the crosshairs of Günter Beckenbauer, the man who intends to demolish the house. He even calls the city about the cats who live there, which delays the demolition. Vengeful, Günter notifies animal control that Bella is a pitbull (despite not looking like one), because in Denver, pitbulls are illegal, due to being a dangerous breed. That evening, an overzealous animal control officer named Chuck comes by to warn Lucas that if he finds Bella on the street, he will impound her.
The next day, when Bella gets out to chase a squirrel, Lucas catches up to her and prepares to take her home, but Chuck confiscates Bella and takes her into the local animal shelter. Lucas picks Bella up, pays a fine, and is allowed to take her home, but he is warned that if Bella is captured again, she will be euthanized. To avoid this, Lucas sends Bella to live with Olivia's aunt and uncle in Farmington, New Mexico, until he and his mother can find another home outside of Denver's urban limits. However, Bella misses Lucas so much that she leaves Farmington and begins a 400-mile journey home, which will take more than two years to complete. During Bella's journey, she befriends a cougar cub, whom she names ""Big Kitten."" Bella and Big Kitten encounter many ordeals together, including being hunted by a pack of coyotes, but a group of men help Bella and frighten the coyotes away. The three men give Bella food at their campsite and upon learning who her owner is, try to call Lucas, only to be scared away by the sudden arrival of Big Kitten. During the winter, Bella helps rescue a man buried in an avalanche. Eventually, she reaches a small town, where she is temporarily taken in by a homeless veteran named Axel until he soon dies. Back in the wilderness, Bella is attacked by coyotes again, but Big Kitten, now fully grown, returns and intervenes, successfully fighting off the coyotes. At each place Bella goes, she learns that each of her new friends has its own home, and how she must keep moving to get back to her family.
After encountering further challenges, Bella finally makes it back to Denver, and she bids Big Kitten farewell before they part ways. She reaches the city's VA hospital, where she joyfully reunites with Lucas, Terri, and Olivia. Lucas prepares to take Bella to the vet to treat an injury Bella received due to being struck by a car, but when Lucas, Terri, and Lucas's friends bring Bella outside, Chuck arrives with several police officers, including police captain Mica. Chuck claims that he needs to confiscate Bella again, with the threat to have Lucas and anyone who interferes arrested otherwise. Captain Mica states that he enforces the law, which states that Bella must be impounded, but Lucas and Terri stand up for Bella and explain that there is no reason to confiscate Bella as the VA hospital is federal property, and thus it is not technically part of Denver. Captain Mica allows Lucas to keep Bella as he has no jurisdiction. Chuck threatens to pull Lucas over if he sees Bella leave the premises, but Captain Mica admonishes Chuck and pulls him from public field duty for his over-zealousness and the number of complaints against him, then orders the police officers not to pull anybody over just for a dog. Lucas and Olivia are happy to see Bella again and finally manage to move into a house in Golden, where they allow pitbulls. Meanwhile Big Kitten is revealed to be a mother herself now and she and her daughter watch over the city of Denver.

4,A Star is Born,United States,Warner Bros. Animation,Warner Bros. ,,,135,,36000000,436188866,,,,,"For his directorial debut—the third official remake of William A. Wellman’s 1937 showbiz melodrama—Bradley Cooper really seems to have learned from George Cukor’s 1954 version of the story: his wide-screen compositions are bold and expansive, the emotional content nuanced and perceptive, and the musical numbers work to deepen one’s understanding of the characters. The film pales in comparison to Cukor’s masterpiece (but then, what showbiz melodrama doesn’t?), in large part because Cooper, playing the self-destructive star who’s unable to handle his wife’s success when it begins to eclipse his own, doesn’t convey the repressed self-loathing that made James Mason so poignant in the role. Pop singer Lady Gaga is quite good as the wife, however; she subtly and convincingly manages the character’s transformation from vulnerable ingenue to self-confident celebrity.

",,"God doesn’t take the stage until the second song in Roman White’s good-hearted summer camp-set Netflix musical “A Week Away.” His sudden invocation hints at a cheeky sense of humor about the whole thing that is sadly lacking from the majority of the movie. There’s nothing really sneaky about the white bread Christianity — pretty plain stuff about how God loves everyone and it’s nice to be kind to people — at the soul of White’s film, but the sudden mentions of God, the Bible, and salvation are first introduced with a winking nature that hints at a funnier, fresher feature underneath. Yet even as “A Week Away” wears its relentlessly optimistic and cheesy soul on its sleeve, it’s hard to dislike.

Before God and his catchy tunes, however, there is young Will Hawkins (Zac Efron lookalike Kevin Quinn, best known for another summer camp-set project, the Disney TV series “Bunk’d”). A teen orphan who has cycled through cities, schools, and foster families since the tragic death of his parents, Will is about to be tossed into a juvenile detention facility after, get this, stealing a cop car (he just “borrowed it!,” he argues, and that’s about all we’ll ever have explained about that). Salvation arrives in the form of perky Kristin (Sherri Shepherd) and her dorky-but-sweet son George (a charming Jahbril Cook in his feature debut), who offer to take Will in for a session at their beloved summer camp.Will’s reticence is understandable — the cop car-stealing orphan really doesn’t seem like the summer camp type — but he’s got no other choice. It’s camp or juvie. He may be a tough kid, but he’s not a stupid one. It’s worrying though, how quickly Kristin starts singing about God, which is made all the worse by how quickly every other kid on the summer camp bus does, too. By the third vaguely Jesus-y song, Will finally catches on. He’s going to a Christian summer camp. Oops!

His attention is soon elsewhere, as upon landing at the camp, cheery Avery (Bailee Madison) catches his eye, while smarmy overachiever Sean (Iain Tucker) tickles his competitive side. What’s a few days with the God Squad? (And, perhaps more earnestly: what’s a few days with some genuinely nice people who don’t seem at all suspicious of the tattooed stranger in their midst?) While the story beats of “A Week Away” are predictable to anyone who has ever watched any sort of YA rom-com — Sean’s trajectory in particular feels pre-ordained by a dozen other films — this one seems wholly at ease with its tropes, livening them up with a large assortment of musical sequences to keep things fun and flashy.

White, a prolific music video director who has shot videos for stars like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Carrie Underwood, previously directed the similarly themed VOD musical “Summer Forever” in 2015. There’s no question White knows his way around a peppy song-and-dance sequence, and the infectious joy of even the most confusing of songs (the film whinges between zippy original pop anthems and incredibly earnest mash-ups of established Christian tunes with absolute abandon) will have even non-believers raising their fists in the air. Yet some of the film’s more ambitious sequences, like a neon-colored extravaganza that plays out in George’s head, are cut oddly short, while a montage set to a song that was likely meant to be performed by the cast, not just played over the action, feels out of place in what’s such a pure musical.And while the film’s Christian bent is most obvious in its songs — even a kicky jam about taking risks eventually comes to feel a bit like a banger about baptism — other elements hint at its literally modest aims. One sequence set at the camp’s lake is packed with sun-drenched, smiling teens, but it’s soon clear that there isn’t a bikini in the bunch, not even a bare chest or leg: each camper is fully outfitted in shirts and tanks (even the boys) and every girl is also sporting a pair of shorts over their suits. It’s wholesome!

The forgettable title is explained during a tone-deaf sequence in which David tells Will that the camp is called “Camp Aweegaway” because campers spend “a week away” from home, seven days that just might change their lives. At least that helps clear up how long the action is playing out, as “A Week Away” could be easily be set over the course of four days or four weeks. The basic operations of the camp are similarly confusing (there appear to be only two adults on site, and as dazzling as Shepherd’s smile is, it’s never explained what she actually does at Aweegaway), plus its overall population, which fluctuates entirely based on how many bodies are needed for a particular musical sequence.

Thanks to some peppy songs and surprisingly solid performances (Madison, a former child star, adds a real heft to some of the film’s most formulaic scenes; Cook is very funny as the quirky best pal) mean that “A Week Way” is good enough anyone with a “High School Musical”-sized hole in their entertainment consumption. Its low-key religious underpinnings — truly, no one even hauls out a Bible during the entire film — likely won’t rankle the secular set, even as Christian kids will be happy to see their worldview reflected by way of a mild crowd-pleaser. It’s hammy, it’s predictable, it’s a little silly, but what YA musical isn’t?",5.5,1098,"Drama,Family,Musical",Positive,0.797

The film, based on Zane's best-selling novel of the same name and adapted by Christina Welsh and Ernie Barbarash, was released theatrically on January 30, 2014.","Section: Plot (1):
Zoe Reynard (Sharon Leal) has the perfect life with her husband Jason (Boris Kodjoe) and two children, and is the CEO of her own company which signs and develops aspiring artists. One evening she attends an art show of Quinton Canosa (William Levy); the two meet and share some flirtation. Zoe later visits his apartment to discuss a contract, and the two have sex.
Zoe feels immense guilt and tries to end it with Quinton; they break up regularly but always inevitably end up getting back together. On one particular occasion, when Zoe goes to get back with Quinton, she finds him having sex with his neighbour.
Throughout the film, Zoe is telling this story as a flashback to her psychotherapist, Dr. Marcella Spencer (Tasha Smith), who after diagnosing her with sex addiction, assumes it might have been something from Zoe's past that keeps coming back to haunt her and pressures her to confess. However, each time her psychotherapist asks, Zoe avoids the question and walks out.
Zoe's addiction begins to take over her life; she soon begins sleeping with a second man, Corey (Tyson Beckford), whom she met at a club. One day, when she comes home from work, she finds Corey at her home talking to her mother. Seeing the danger she had put her family in, Zoe decides that she wants to try to fix her marriage with Jason. She invites both Corey and Quinton to meet her at Quinton's apartment and breaks up with both of them.
Corey becomes angry and lunges at her but Quinton blocks him. As Corey leaves, Quinton knocks him out with a vase. Zoe becomes afraid of Quinton and tries to calm him down; Quinton tells her that she is not going to leave him. Frightened, Zoe shoves glass artwork between them, smashing it to pieces. She then hides from Quinton who is chasing her with a knife. Suddenly Jason appears and smashes a sculpture over Quinton's head.
Zoe runs after Jason, apologizing profusely, but he rejects her. Out of desperation, Zoe walks in front of car, injuring herself. The two split up and Jason stays in a hotel. Zoe becomes a recluse but soon goes to a sex addiction group-therapy session. It is discovered that the root of Zoe's addiction was because of a rape committed by three boys when she was 10 years old. At the session she speaks of her deep love for her husband, and Jason walks in, kisses her and accepts her back.

7,All My Friends Are Dead,Poland,"Aurum Film
",,,,96,,,,,,,,"Perhaps there’s something the Poles can teach us all about unfiltered, unfettered youth sex horror comedies. Or at least the Slovenian who wrote and directed “All My Friends Are Dead” could pass on his thoughts.

This is a standard-issue Hollywood “dead teenagers” movie grafted onto the teen party run amok comedy. It is Polish and positively drenched in bad messaging, enthusiastic sex, drugs, drink and bodily fluids.

It’s not offensive, just not for the easily offended. I can’t say I found it particularly funny, but there are amusing bits. And listing the raunchy teen comedy tropes — from “American Pie” and its ilk — could be a fun watching party game if you get bored.

Two cops walk through a crime scene, a New Year’s house party littered with corpses.

A girl in a neck brace is hauled out on a gurney muttering “end of the WORLD” and “All my friends are dead!” (in Polish with subtitles, or dubbed).

Jaded Inspector Kwasniewski (Adam Woronowicz) looks at the shooting victims, stabbing victims, the guy hanging and the bodies piled all over the living room and sighs.

Newby cop Grzegorz Dabrowski (Michal Meyer) vomits.

They take a moment to ponder what they’re looking at, barely hazarding a thought as to what happened here or there or in the laundry room or the study. And then a flashback shows us the bloody baccanale that led to this body count.

The party has so many commonalities with movies like “Can’t Hardly Wait” that ticking them off should be a drinking game. Not that I’m suggesting that.

There’s a young couple so smitten the guy is sure to propose any minute now, with his pretty lady friend maybe not quite there yet.

Pawal (Nikodem Rozbicki) shows up with a self-identified MILF (Monika Krzywkowska).

Thirtyish Dariusz (Wojciech Lozowski) is trying to shed himself of clingy, hysterical and teenaged Pinky (Barbara Garstka).

Wild child Oliwia (Aleksandra Pisula) is also too old to be here. But hey.

Marek (Kamil Piotrowski) is the host, the dude whose parents are out of town, not trying that hard to keep the peace, and quick to taunt and then stiff the hapless pizza guy (Adam Bobik).

There are people pairing up and sneaking off to rooms hither and yon for hook-ups, threesomes, bondage etc. “demonstrations,” quasi-orgies and cocaine and vodka and mushrooms and betrayals. There’s more than one crisis of faith, but only one stoned, orgied-out boy sees visions of Jesus.

We can see that a handful of characters have genuine motive to act out, maybe even violently, because of the way the evening is going down.

And then sure enough, a gun appears and jerk Marek is the first to die. “All My Friends are Dead” (“Wszyscy moi przyjaciele nie zyja” in Polish) stumbles out of the gate, finds occasional bursts of energy and manic moments of grossness — urophilia and the ends one character will go to in order to prove that the fresh red puddle on the floor isn’t blood, but ketchup.

Clever cross-cutting of the dancing/karaoke with the sexing, set to ’80s Western pop like “Gloria,” is funny.

But most of the deaths aren’t. And after a couple, there’s a rush to wrap all this carnage up in an epic finale that isn’t quite “final.”

This isn’t the worst debut feature I’ve seen this week, so writer-director Jan Belcl, better luck with “Wszyscy moi przyjaciele nie zyja II.”",5.8,4265," Comedy, Crime, Drama ",Negative,0.923
8,Animals on the Loose: A You vs. Wild Interactive Movie,United States,The Natural Studios,Netflix,,,90,,,,,,,,"The Gist: Opening shot: THE SUN. Pan down to: A MASSIVE PILE OF POOP. Ostentatious beginning! Then: A foot smashes the poop. It’s Bear Grylls’ foot! But hopefully not his poop! And he’s being chased by a lion! Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-it. Subtitle: EARLIER THAT DAY. Bear is on the African savannah. The electric fence surrounding the protected area is broken. A telltale tuft of fur on the chainlink tells Bear that a lion is loose in an area where people are camping. On top of that, a baboon named Thimba is AWOL. Bear has three tasks: Rescue the baboon, restore the fence’s electrical power and do something about that lion. Time to pick one, which means you’re gonna be forced to decide whether monkey peril should be prioritized over human peril. And you thought Sophie’s Choice was a tough one.

Pick the lion adventure, and Bear hops on horseback to navigate the terrain and maybe give the lion a meal that isn’t him? Maybe he’s not thinking that, but we sure as hell are. Some wildlife researchers are out there having a BBQ party, which puts Bear in the lion-trapping business before the lion gets into the wildlife researcher-eating business. Maybe Bear should build a pen out of shrubs and sticks to contain the lion even though it clearly chomped through a fence already? That’s an idea. Or perhaps there’s a less boring option that means Bear has to pop the rescue flare? Decisions, decisions.

That’s one rough example of the myriad choices we face during Bear’s three missions. One toughie has us puzzling over whether he should swim through an ocean teeming with sharks, build a raft or climb a cliff. (Hey, sharks gotta eat too.) Another is a Gryllsian classic: Should he chew this corpulent, squirming leech to death, or swallow it whole? Either way, that vile thing is gonna shake hands with Bear’s stomach acid. And it’ll all eventually catch up to the poop-stomping scene, and whether our goofy protag figures out how to not have his limbs torn asunder by a big cat. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Didn’t that Black Mirror movie a while back do a similar choose-your-own-adventure thing, except, like, more existentially disturbing?

Performance Worth Watching: Thimba the baboon needs his own spinoff series. I’d like to get to know him better.

Memorable Dialogue: “It’s gonna be like nature’s sausage — full of blood.” — Bear assesses the potential toothsomeness of the leech

Sex and Skin: None. The PG rating is for “gore” only.

Our Take: If you thought Bear Grylls had utterly exhausted the survival-series formula by the time he slid down a mudhill with Tom Arnold, you were wrong — wrong as hell. He continues to be the TV world’s most popular larva-eater and poop-toucher, and in Animals on the Loose, he goes so far as to pick up elephant crap for no good reason whatsoever. And to think, he has to use those same filthy hands to eat raw larvae for lunch.

This special is really really really really silly. Bear lures a lion by limping and moaning, fights a snake, yells at elephants and, a moment later, shushes the elephants. During a sequence in which he scares a cheetah with his jacket, I’m not sure he and the jacket are ever in the same shot with the cheetah. He shares some survival tips along the way, some of which will come in handy if you ever find yourself clambering up the slippery rocks of a rapidly flooding downhill creek or faced with eating either a grub for long-term protein energy or num-num berries for a short-term sugar boost (strangely, he never even considers eating both — maybe the gross one first , then chase it with the delicious one?). may have made a mistake in not choosing to rescue Thimba first, because maybe Bear could’ve completed his other tasks with something we all wish we had: a BABOON SIDEKICK. Maybe I should do it over again, and of course, that option exists — press pause mid-adventure, and you can revisit past choices. If only the real world was like this, you could go back and correct all those wrong turns at Albuquerque you made, so to speak. But alas. I recall Bear getting a bit philosophical in Man vs. Wild, when he’d construct a shelter out of fronds and settle in for a long night under the stars and among the large predators that might kill him if he didn’t have a crew with him, helping him manufacture quasi-reality television. He doesn’t do that here — get philosophical, I mean — so let’s not get too melancholy about whether we could do it all over again, and just appreciate Animals on the Loose for the satisfactory entertainment that it is.

Our Call: STREAM IT. Like the rest of the You vs. Wild series, Animals on the Loose is fun enough I guess, partly because Bear is so genial, and works so hard to sell this ridiculous stuff. It’s a decent time-waster at 45 minutes or so, especially for younger viewers to work through once — and probably never again — assuming they don’t spew their Lunchables across the room at the money shot of raw, black grub goo dripping from our loveable host’s mouth. Then again, that’s nothing Bear fans haven’t seen before.",5.9,626," Adventure, Reality-TV",Negative,0.657

The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $41 million against its $5 million budget.","Section: Plot (1):
Scarlett Marlowe, a young alchemy scholar, continues her dead father's work searching for the philosopher's stone, a legendary alchemical substance capable of turning base metals into gold or silver and grant eternal life, discovered by Nicolas Flamel. After finding the ""Rose Key"" in a cave in Iran which she narrowly escapes as it collapses, she travels to Paris, where she enlists the help of George, her former lover. Along with Benji the cameraman, they translate Flamel's headstone, which contains a riddle that leads them 370 feet underneath the streets of Paris. She enlists the help of a guide called Papillon, his girlfriend Souxie, and friend Zed to search the Catacombs of Paris. George refuses to go but is driven into the caves with the group when a policeman spots them. After crawling through a narrow tunnel which collapses, they encounter female cultists who are singing and appear possessed. They find themselves in a blocked tunnel that Papillion is reluctant to breach, as the only people who have gone through, including Pap's friend La Taupe (The Mole), have never been seen again. The group attempts to take a different path but accidentally loop back around to where they were, and they are forced to go through the tunnel.
After venturing deeper into the catacombs, they encounter La Taupe, who agrees to guide them out and informs them the only way out is down. They eventually find a tomb with a preserved Templar Knight, a mound of treasure, and the Flamel Stone. Removing the stone, Scarlett realizes too late that the treasure is a trap, and the room collapses. La Taupe is lost under the rubble and is left behind by the group.
With the Flamel Stone, Scarlett magically heals the group's injuries. They find a drawing of a door on the ceiling along with a Gnostic Star of David, symbolizing ""As above, so below"", revealing a door hidden in the floor. Going through the opening, they find a tunnel marked with the phrase ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"" in Greek, identical to the entrance to Hell in Dante's Inferno.
Passing through, they find a dark reflection of the room they left, including La Taupe, who kills Souxie, before disappearing in the narrow tunnels. They realize they must continue and go deeper to escape. Along the way, Benji the cameraman is pushed to his death down a hole by the lead female cultist. They encounter a burning car and an occupant, an incident from Pap's past who pulls in Papillon and sinks into the floor. They fail to pull Pap out of the ground. As they continue, they see apparitions of terrifying spirits and demons. Statues in the wall come to life, and one violently attacks George. After trying to drag him further, George murmurs, ""Vitriol"", another riddle from earlier, and Scarlett realizes the Flamel stone itself is yet another trap. Only by returning it will she find the real stone.
As she races back to the crypt, she recognizes a man who hanged himself as her father. After nearly being drowned in a line of blood by an unseen force, she returns to the crypt and finds a polished mirror, which is when she realizes she has the magical abilities of the stone. She returns to George, kissing him as she heals him. She explains they must confront their torments, as this place provides an alternate form of reality. As the hooded demons chase them, they find and jump down a deep hole. They first believe there is no logical way of surviving the fall but survive. At the bottom, they see the hole is no longer there. Eventually, Scarlett, George, and Zed find a manhole on the floor, which when pushed down delivers them right side up onto the surface, on a street overlooking the Notre Dame. Scarlett and George hold each other while Zed walks away, finally safe. In an ending log, Scarlett is heard saying she never sought treasure, only the truth.

With permission from the French authorities the film was shot in the real catacombs of Paris. There was very little use of props, as the actors had to use the environment around them. Production in the actual catacombs was difficult for the cast and especially the crew as there was no electricity or cell phone service in the centuries-old tunnels. As Ben Feldman suffered from claustrophobia, he had to keep taking breaks to cope.

Debruge also called the ending ""unspeakably corny.""  Kyle Anderson's review in Entertainment Weekly stated, ""As Above has some genuine scares.  The stakes begin as gut-wrenchingly real with the team feeling disoriented hundreds of meters beneath the streets, but the film gets downright silly once the caverns become malevolently sentient.

Peter Bradshaw stated in The Guardian. ""There are some interestingly contrived moments of claustrophobia and surreal lunacy, but this clichéd and slightly hand-me-down script neither scares nor amuses very satisfyingly.  Drew Hunt expressed similar sentiments in The Chicago Reader, writing ""An intriguing and intensely creepy premise is squandered on this rudimentary found-footage horror film.""  Terry Staunton gave the film a mildly positive review in Radio Times, stating, ""It's a perfectly serviceable addition to the 'found footage' genre of chillers from director/co-writer John Erick Dowdle (Devil), who puts cameras in each character's helmet, allowing quick cuts from one scene to another. But despite the claustrophobia of the setting, he never quite racks up enough tension for a full-on fright-fest.""  The entertainment oriented website JoBlo wrote, ""Not the worst example of found footage by a long shot, and it moves a decent pace with a couple of good scares. However, this could have been a far more frightening feature if only it had expanded on its scary premise.""

10,Asphalt Burning,Norway,Gifted Films,,,,100,,,3989896,,,,,"So a ’67 Boss 302 Mustang, a Porsche 991 GTS Turbo, a Toyota GT86 and an ’80 Pace Car Corvette cut loose on the Nürburgring…

Did I lose you? Fine. Go over and read the reviews of “Asphalt Burning” typed by the never-drove-a-stickshift Nancys. I see a couple have posted already.

“Asphalt,” titled “Børning 3” in the Old Country because our Norwegian gearhead (girhode) friends have made three of these things, is a goof — a girhode car comedy more on the order of “Cannonball Run” than “Fast and Furious” or “Rask og Rasende” to the herring eaters.

Dumb? Sure. Funny? Sometimes it is. Cars? Fords and Chevys and Toyotas and Porsches and Lincolns, souped-up, rat-rodded or simply restored, and chased in this case by German cops in a gullwing BMW i8.

The plot is patently ridiculous. Norske street racing “legend” Roy Gundersen (Anders Baasmo Christiansen) is finally, three films in, ready to remarry. He’s had a baby with Sylvia (Kathrine Thorborg Johansen) and has the approval of his grown gearhead daughter Nina (Ida Husøy). Let’s get the gang together for a little fjordside cookout/carfest, finishing with a mock “race” to the mountaintop where Sylvia and the preacher await.

“First one to the top gets the bride!”

But there’s a German minx in the mix. Robyn (Alexandra Maria Lara) is a racecar driver from Deutschland who flirts with Roy, gets a kiss out of him, and then races her Porsche to the front of the wedding party pack to claim Sylvia at the top.

“This is not the man for you!” she barks, as she rats out the smooch and we find out that she and Sylvia have history.

The stupid script has this incident wreck the wedding, with only a proper “rematch” deciding who gets the bride, who is quite irked at Roy’s indiscretion.

The earlier films in this series were Norwegian street and road race tales. But this time, they’ll convoy through Sweden, Denmark and Germany. And then they’ll go car to car/”pink slip for pink slip” in Valhalla for Gearheads, the Nürburgring.

Many mishaps and misadventures are sure to happen along the way.You don’t have to have seen the earlier films to pick up on the “types” on Roy’s “team.” There’s TT (Trond Halbo) who is into vintage Toyotas, for instance. My favorite is the guy they basically cast because he looks like a Norwegian version of “Top Gear” alumnus Jeremy Clarkson — grizzled “Trollhunter” veteran Otto Jespersen. He’s Nybakken, the Big Block Whisperer, a wizard with engines but a tad hapless at life.

The gags that kind of work include using a souped-up Cadillac hearse, which is mistaken for the real thing by some clueless Swedes, and adding a “Swedish Roy” and “German Roy” — both car guys — into the mix to confuse poor, unforgiving Sylvia.

The German cops bicker over F-1 drivers and take speeding down there damned seriously.

“Nobody messes with my Autobahn!” is funniest in the original German.

Lemmy Müller (Henning Baum) calls himself “The Mustang Killer of Hamburg.” You can’t pass through Germany without racing him on the docks, and yeah, he looks just like Lemmy from Motörhead.

Running gags from the earlier films (their nemesis/cop is now driving a tour bus) don’t amount to much, and you can say the same for the film.

But there are some cute bits. Norwegian 1960s pop-star turned actress Wenche Myhre gets Nybakken’s romantic attention via a song and dance number.

The funniest thing about it all is the mere fact that it exists, this silly nothing of a comedy film series built around European “AmCar” nuts, fans of American muscle back from way back when.

No, it’s not much of a movie. But if any of those conceits tickles your clutch-pedal foot, it’s good for a laugh or three. It’s for “girhodes” only. ",5.1,1710,Action | Comedy,Negative,0.891

Despite Chastain's performance receiving praise, the film received negative reviews.","Section: Plot (1):
Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a recovering addict and former soldier turned assassin. In France, she kidnaps her new target, an English businessman. Before she kills him, she questions him on why someone wants him dead. Unbeknownst to her, another woman electronically eavesdrops on the conversation.  Afterwards, Ava flies to Boston where she visits with her estranged sister Judy and her mother who is hospitalized for angina pain.  Ava has not seen them in eight years.  
Ava's handler and former Army superior, Duke, sends her to Saudi Arabia to kill a German general. Ava lures the general into a trap and injects him with a poison to make it appear he died of a heart attack. She is interrupted by the general's security guards.  A gunfight ensues, leaving all the men dead.  
Ava escapes and travels to Barneville-Carteret where Duke apologizes for the botched operation, insisting that the bad intel was a simple mistake.  He gives her time off to decompress and she returns to Boston and meets Michael, her former fiance who is now in a relationship with her sister Judy.
In British Columbia, Duke meets with his superior, Simon.  Simon's daughter Camille is the woman who had earlier eavesdropped on Ava's hit.  Simon believes Ava is a liability and that her questioning of targets demonstrates insufficient commitment to their operation.  After Duke leaves, Simon reaffirms the hit on Ava.  She kills her attacker and then confronts Duke who insists that it was a random drug addict attack.  That night, Ava goes to dinner with Judy and Michael but their conversation does not go well. The next morning, Judy meets Ava and tells her Michael is missing. Realizing he has started gambling again, Ava rescues him from a gambling den run by a woman, Toni, to whom Michael is indebted. 
Duke revisits Simon and reveals he knew Ava was set up. A fight ensues between the two men, resulting in Simon killing Duke. He sends a video of Duke's death to Ava. A heartbroken Ava goes to Judy's house, where she invites Michael to run away with her but he declines, revealing that Judy is pregnant. Ava heads to Toni's den where she kills some of her men before giving Toni a bag of money to pay off Michael's debt. Ava strangles Toni, then changes her mind, letting Toni live while warning her to stay away from Michael.
Back at her hotel, Ava is attacked by Simon. They fight, with both sustaining serious injuries. Exhausted, Simon flees when the fire alarm goes off, warning Ava that he will kill her if he sees her again.  Ava pursues Simon, cornering and killing him under the Zakim Bridge. Ava goes to her sister's house, warning Judy to leave the country and giving her the number to a Swiss bank account filled with Ava's earnings. Before she leaves, Michael gives her a letter from Duke, who says that he is happy with how his life turned out. As she walks down the street, Ava is stalked by Simon's daughter, Camille.

Writing for The Hollywood Reporter Boyd van Hoeij said that ""Chastain is utterly convincing in another tough-as-nails role. If audiences stick with the movie, it's largely thanks to her movie-star charisma, which almost compensates for the increasingly ridiculous plot.

Bad Trip received generally positive reviews from critics.","Section: Plot (1):
In small-town Florida, Chris is working at a car wash when a woman, Maria, arrives. Chris tells the man whose car he's washing that she is his high school crush. He begins to vacuum the car but the overpowered vacuum sucks his clothes off, leaving him naked. He panics and hides in the car. The man has a conversation with Maria, attempting to get her number for Chris, but she declines and leaves. 
Chris' best friend, Bud, is working at a computer shop, where his sister, Trina, pulls up in her car. After having a conversation with two customers, she begs Bud for money but he refuses. Although on house arrest, she robs the store and removes her ankle tag, gives money to the two customers, warning them not to snitch. Later, Chris and Bud talk about Trina, Maria, and going on big adventures.
One year later, a plumber enters Chris' house and Chris surprises him by rising from a bathtub full of beer cans. Chris realises he's late and runs to his new job at a smoothie shop, causing chaos along the way. Maria enters the shop and they have a conversation, where she reveals she runs an art gallery in New York City. She gives him her card for the gallery. Looking at the card causes him to lose focus and accidentally catch his hand in a smoothie blender, splattering blood everywhere. 
He later asks advice from an old man, who tells him to follow Maria to New York. Chris then sings a musical number called ""I Saw a Girl Today"" to the confusion of everyone around him. Talking with Bud on the bus, they make the ultimate plan for a road trip to New York. Chris gets the idea to steal Trina's car, which Bud first opposes, but Chris reminds him that Trina's in jail.
Bud pays to remove the car from an impound. Meanwhile, Trina escapes from jail. She finds out her car was taken and plans to kill Bud and Chris, stealing a police car to hunt them down. Chris and Bud wreck a gas station pump, go drinking at a bar where Chris vomits uncontrollably and falls off a high ledge after having too many shots, and visit a zoo where Chris is raped by a gorilla after breaking into its enclosure to take a selfie with it. 
They later crash Trina's car and get into a big argument, ending their friendship, until an army recruiter tells Chris some words of wisdom. Chris finds Bud on a bus back to Florida and they make up, finally making it to Maria's art gallery. Trina sees her damaged car and finding Marie's business card covered with Chris' blood, she continues to hunt them down. After Chris declares his love for Maria, she rejects him before Trina drives through the art gallery wall, attacking Chris with various pieces of art.
Trina chases Chris down, dangling him off the gallery roof, but Bud saves him by finally standing up to her. She embraces him, proud that he finally stood up for himself. Chris and Bud return to Maria's gallery, but she is distraught at the chaos and demands that they leave. The film ends with them deciding to cross-dress as white women at an environmentalist fundraising gala, which they had discussed while reviewing White Chicks earlier in the film, with Trina joining them as a white man. 
They perform the DMX song ""Party Up"" on stage, much to the discomfort of everybody else. Behind-the-scenes footage plays during the closing credits, showing the reactions of the people who appeared throughout the film upon being told they are part of a hidden camera prank.

",,"A lot of thrillers begin with or feature a prison-bus break-out as a signature scene — “48 Hrs.” and “The Fugitive,” for instance. But here’s one that’s all about the break-out, or break-in depending on your point of view.

“Below Zero (Bajocero)” is a simple, brutal and harrowing Spanish thriller about an assault on a prison transport bus outbound from Cuenca in the harsh Spanish winter. Director and co-writer Lluís Quílez (“Out of the Dark”) throws misdirection plays at us that bely its simplicity and reliance on basically one location to make an action feature with quirky characters that set up quirkier twists.

That location is the interior of a maximum security prison bus, basically an “armored bunker” on wheels as the driver Martín (Javier Gutiérrez) declares, at one point. He’s a veteran cop on his first “transfer” in a long time.

He’s a family man teamed-up with the brutish Montesinos (Isak Férriz) to haul six dangerous inmates from one prison to another. “Discretion” and “surprise” dictate that they do this in the middle of the night.

But as we see the inmates rounded up to leave, we see one procure a key, and hide it even where a strip search won’t give it away. Ahem.

Montesinos is brusque, no nonsense, inclined to throw his weight around. Martín is the “rules aren’t there to be ‘relaxed'” and “You can’t beat up every dirtbag who gets in your face” stickler.

We’ll see who’s the smarter cop and who’s tougher when the bus is waylaid on a foggy surface road on this longest night of their lives.

The inmates are a colorful crew of varying ages and “types.” The dangerous Romanian human trafficker Mihei (Florin Opritescu) is the one they’re most worried about. Motor-mouthed Gollum (Andrés Gertrúdix) is a nuisance, young Nano (Patrick Criado) has as many tattoos as any of them, aged Pardo (Miquel Gelabert) is in for some major financial crime, tough-as-nails Rei (Édgar Vittorino) simmers in silence, unless you bring up his sister.

And then there’s the cunning and charismatic older con (Luis Callejo), who insists on going by (in Spanish with English subtitles) “my stage name, Ramis.” Like the rest, Ramis promises to be a handful. That’s why each has his own steel-walled cell for the ride.

And then the ride is intercepted. Do we know who pulled this off, “took care” of the escort police cruiser and blew out a tire? Do “they” know who has come to release them, or just one of them, with the possibility the attackers will kill everyone else on board?

After a few seriously illogical moments setting up this backroad hijacking, leaving wounded Martín on his own with six dangerous men, “Below Zero” settles in to a siege filled with surprises.

Callejo, who was Joseph in the Biblical thriller “Risen,” makes a colorful creep who can’t be trusted, even if he’s showing you his hand.

Gutiérrez, a Netflix staple thanks to “Assassin’s Creed,” “The Motive,” “Marshlands” and “The Occupant,” makes a believably over-matched cop who finds the nerve to bluff when his life is on the line.

But as “types,” these characters are all just “Who dies or lies next?” pawns to be played with in the Fernando Navarro and Quílez screenplay, one that considers every way to get into and out of a locked “armored bunker” with whoever’s trying to get at them outside, and a dozen ways to die inside.

It’s no “48 Hrs.” or “Fugitive,” but “Below Zero” is a good one, with or without subtitles. ",6.2,13567,Thriller,Positive,0.511
15,Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell,United States,,Netflix,,,96,,,,,,,,"One wonders what Notorious B.I.G would have thought about smartphones. The late New York MC, who is the subject of a new Netflix documentary titled Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell, was an eager evangelist of the humble camcorder. Early on in the documentary, his longtime friend Damion “D-Roc” Butler explains how Biggie instructed him to capture the audiences at their concerts. The resulting footage is electric — a preserved vision of a hip-hop golden era, shown from the vantage point of one of its most culturally influential stars. By now, grainy archival footage is a hallmark of the growing genre of music documentary, but here it serves a more imperative function. Biggie’s story is one that’s been told, retold, and repackaged as a part of our cultural imagination, a straight line from “Big Poppa” to beefing with Tupac to his eventual murder in 1997. The flattened narrative of East Coast versus West Coast rap has served, mostly, to obscure the man Biggie was. Throughout Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell, Butler’s trusty camcorder offers a much-needed corrective.Directed by Emmett Malloy, whose past credits include a White Stripes documentary and numerous music videos, this film is not likely to illuminate any truly new information about the career of the rapper born Christopher Wallace. Many of the sentiments shared in Biggie have been hashed out in various TV specials and movies, and the talking heads are familiar to anyone versed in Nineties hip-hop: We see Sean “Diddy” Combs delivering somber remembrances of his close friend, as well as Biggie’s mother, Voletta Wallace, describing the moment she received the news of her son’s death. What the film achieves instead is filling in the gaps between Biggie’s early life in Brooklyn and his days of superstardom. It spends almost no time on his most iconic moments, opting instead to offer screentime to the more humanizing elements of his life. We’re made privy to the family he had in Jamaica, who were central in his musical development. We hear from the jazz musician Donald Harrison, who lived on Biggie’s block and, recognizing a natural talent, took it upon himself to expose his neighbor to the arts at an early age. At one point, Harrison describes Biggie’s unique ear for rhyme, comparing his cadence to jazz drums before we cut to footage of a young Biggie rapping to a solo by the legendary drummer Max Roach.

The documentary’s greatest strength might be the seriousness with which it approaches the drug trade in Brooklyn in the early Nineties. Beyond simple rap-mythologizing, we gain insight into the reality on the ground for Biggie at the time. It’s a welcome perspective shift. Much of the public’s understanding of the era of rap that was born from the crack epidemic in the United States exists in hyperbolic terms: hardened drug dealers duking it out for supremacy in gritty streets. The truth, as Biggie carefully unfurls, is more complicated. At the time, the drug trade was a piece of the social fabric that existed for kids in the neighborhood. Rather than treat this as a taboo to be infantilized, the film explains these dynamics with the same seriousness one might approach American history. Key players in Brownsville — Olie, aka “Big O,” and his uncle I-God — add historical context to the story of how Biggie both came into and exited the drug game. 

Old footage of Bed Stuy, Brooklyn has a certain haunting quality to it. The forces of gentrification lurk quietly beneath analog footage of a young Biggie boasting on the corner. The film makes good use of graphics to give context to the blocks these men walked, to the world that they occupied. My favorite bit of archival footage comes from a May 24th, 1992 video of a young Chistopher Wallace performing in Brooklyn. It’s before the release of “Party and Bullshit,” just as his skills are beginning to sharpen. An urgency comes through clearly, and you get the sense, watching from the future, of just how singular a figure he was in his time.

The power of old tapes is most poignant in the documentary’s bookends. Aerial footage of Biggie’s funeral opens and closes the film, emphasizing the renewed vantage point from which we’re observing the rapper’s life. There are murals, T-shirts, and countless ephemera emblazoned with Biggie’s image in the world; in Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell, we spend the most time observing the faces of the people he impacted. In that way, Biggie offers something in line with a growing crop of documentaries hoping to cast a new light on cultural touchstones that may seem well-trodden. We have plenty of information about the idea of the Notorious B.I.G., but Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell offers a rare look at the actual human being behind the legend.

16,Black Beach,Spain,David Naranjo Villalonga,Netflix,,,125,,,,,,,,"There’s a hardnosed, cynical and downbeat political thriller straining to get out in “Black Beach,” a Spanish film about First World corruption and Third World strife.

It’s a bit of a slog, frustrating and convoluted. The filmmakers can’t gracefully extract themselves from a story that wants to get to its point and end a lot sooner than it does.

But it has virtues worth recognizing and a taut, tense and bloody chase scene through an African slum that will put you on the edge of your seat.

Here’s the take-away from it — it’s a direct evocation of “white privilege” and its echoes in “white man’s burden” Africa.

As Carlos Furster, Raúl Arévalo portrays of man of confidence born of privilege, bravery built on untouchability. He’s the son of a U.N. High Commissioner (Paulina García), an NGO-trained negotiator, now a globe-trotting fixer for Big Oil.

When he’s ordered back to Africa to mediate a hostage situation in a country where he used to work, a nation under a UN embargo but with a big oil deal in the works, he gives no hint that he’s out of his depth.

Carlos knows the principals — the “president” (Emilio Buale), the alleged “leader” of a revolutionary faction (Jimmy Castro) — and the lay of the land. His past gives him contacts that will, he is sure, get him to the hostage and make this all go away without reigniting a civil war.

In this violent place, where people are dying or just disappearing right and left, where leadership lives in utter opulence while most live in slums, Carlos struts around as if he’s bullet proof. Because he is.

Provide him with a Ferrari, give him access to generals, and he all but runs roughshod over the locals in pursuit of his goal. He goes nose-to-nose, threatening the warden at the infamous seaside prison that gives the movie its title — “Black Beach.”

Offer him cocaine, as the president does in a friendly chat, and he’ll take it. Whatever he once was, Carlos finished selling out years ago.

Now he has absolute immunity and utter impunity as he swaggers hither and yon, looking for his old friend Calixto, tracking him through the man’s wife Ada, not considering what his search might reap.

Carlos may be married with a baby on the way. But back in the day, Ada (Aída Wellgaye) was his in-country girlfriend. Now she’s the key to reaching Calixto, finding the hostage and settling all this without violence and the bad optics that will be in the media.

Or so Carlos figures. But right in the middle of his bull-in-the-china-shop search, he picks up on what we cannot miss. People are dying all around him. People he tracks down meet untimely ends.

Nobody in authority will touch the white guy, but every African he arm-twists is instantly imperiled. Carlos is European interference in Africa in a single character. He is good intentions with sinister underpinnings, and eventually even he sees it.

Arévalo (“Marshland,” Almodovar’s “Pain and Glory”) lets us see Carlos transform from a guy working the angles and angling for that New York promotion to somebody who finally turns around to see the destruction in his wake.

Candela Peña plays the guide and former NGO pal Ade, who could be the conscience that he’s forgotten he had. Claude Musungayi is the silky smooth-talking Afro-French boss who dangles that promotion and pays a lot of lip service to his Man in Africa’s safety and future.

Director and co-writer Esteban Crespo (“Amar”) complicates the script to the point of distraction and frustrates the viewer with all the promising possibilities we recognize from other such thrillers (“The Constant Gardener,” “Under Fire,” “The Year of Living Dangerously”) that he refuses to mimic.

The old love story, the “past” that comes back to haunt the hero, the compromises he sees himself making, all are left underdeveloped in this misshapen thriller that rarely gets up the urgency it needs to come off.

But the big chase through the slums, staged on the film’s Canary Islands set, is a bracing suggestion of the thriller that might have been.

The high stakes were always there. The way the film beats around the bush in showing them makes us see that it’s not just Carlos, but the filmmakers making a movie out of his story who are very slow to pick up on that. ",5.6,1134,Action | Drama | Thriller,Positive,0.94

A young George Jung and his parents Fred and Ermine live in Weymouth, Massachusetts. When George is 10 years old, Fred files for bankruptcy, but tries to make George realize that money is not important.
As an adult, George moves to Los Angeles with his friend ""Tuna""; they meet Barbara, an airline stewardess, who introduces them to Derek Foreal, a marijuana dealer. With Derek's help, George and Tuna make a lot of money. Kevin Dulli, a visiting college student from Boston, tells them of the demand for marijuana back home. They start selling marijuana there, buying marijuana directly from Mexico with the help of Santiago Sanchez, a Mexican drug lord. Two years later, George is caught in Chicago trying to import 660 pounds (300 kg) of marijuana and is sentenced to two years. After unsuccessfully trying to plead his innocence, George skips bail to take care of Barbara, who dies from cancer. Her death marks the disbanding of the group of friends.
While hiding from the authorities, George visits his parents. George's mother calls the police, who arrest him. He is sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. His cellmate Diego Delgado has contacts in the Medellin cartel and convinces George to help him go into the cocaine business. Upon his release from prison, George violates his parole conditions and heads down to Cartagena, Colombia to meet with Diego. They meet with cartel officer Cesar Rosa to negotiate the terms for smuggling 15 kilograms (33 lb) to establish ""good faith"".
As the smuggling operation grows, Diego is arrested, leaving George to find a way to sell 50 kg (110 lb). George reconnects with Derek in California, and the two sell all the cocaine. George then goes to Medellín, Colombia and meets Pablo Escobar, who agrees to go into business with them. With the help of Derek, the pair become Escobar's top U.S. importer. At Diego's wedding, George meets Cesar's fiancée Mirtha and later marries her. However, Diego resents George for keeping Derek's identity secret and pressures George to reveal his connection. George eventually discovers that Diego has betrayed him by cutting him out of the connection with Derek. Inspired by the birth of his daughter and a drug-related heart attack, George severs his relationship with the cartel.
All goes well with George's newfound civilian life for five years, until Mirtha organizes a 38th birthday party for him. Many of his former drug associates attend, including Derek, who reveals that Diego eventually cut him out as well. The FBI and DEA raid the party and arrest George. He becomes a fugitive, and his bank account—heretofore under Manuel Noriega's protection in Panama—is seized by Noriega. One night, he and Mirtha get into a fight while driving. They are pulled over by police and Mirtha tells them George is a fugitive and has stashed a kilogram of cocaine in his trunk. He is sent to jail for three years, Mirtha divorces him, and takes custody of their nine-year-old daughter, Kristina Sunshine Jung.
Upon his release, George struggles to maintain his relationship with his daughter. He promises Kristina a vacation in California and seeks one last deal to garner enough money for the trip. George completes a deal with former accomplices but learns too late that the deal had been set up by the FBI and DEA, with Dulli and Derek having leaked the nature and location of the action in exchange for pardons for their involvement in his prior action. George is sentenced to 60 years at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He explains in the end that neither the sentence nor the betrayal bothered him, but that he can never forgive himself for having to break a promise to his daughter.
While in prison, George requests a furlough to see his dying father, Fred. His mother denies the request. George records a final message to Fred, recounting his memories of working with his father, his run-ins with the law, and finally, too late, his understanding of what Fred meant when he said that money is not ""real"". An old man in prison, George imagines that his daughter finally comes to visit him. She slowly fades away as a guard calls for George. The film concludes with notes indicating that Jung will not be eligible for parole until 2015, and that his daughter has yet to visit him.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars, but questioned the value of making Jung the subject of this film, stating: ""That's the thing about George [Jung]. He thinks it's all about him. His life, his story, his success, his fortune, his lost fortune, his good luck, his bad luck. Actually, all he did was operate a toll gate between suppliers and addicts. You wonder, but you never find out, if the reality of those destroyed lives ever occurred to him."" David Nusair of Reel Films also questioned making a film about Jung, stating ""The biggest problem with Blow is that Jung is such a complete moron."" Nusair concludes that while it ""is not a bad film ... the central character of George Jung just doesn't seem worthy to be the center of attention."" Christopher Smith from Bangor Daily News gave the film a ""D+"", stating ""Blow is ultimately more about charisma than it is about truth, more about Depp's smooth strut and tousled hair than it is about George Jung's fatal flaws—his stupidity, desperation, ego and small-town greed.""

Pictures,Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe Mark Strong Golshifteh Farahani Oscar Isaac Simon McBurney,William Monahan,128,Ridley Scott,70000000,115900897,"Body of Lies is a 2008 American action thriller film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by William Monahan. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, and Mark Strong in the lead roles. Set in the Middle East, it follows the attempts of the CIA and Jordanian Intelligence to catch ""al-Saleem"", a terrorist. Frustrated by their target's elusiveness, differences in their approaches strain relations between a CIA operative, his superior, and the head of Jordanian Intelligence.
The screenplay, based on the 2007 novel of the same name by David Ignatius, examines contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies, and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes.
Scott's direction and visual style were praised by critics, but they criticized his formulaic handling of the story and use of conventions from the spy genre, such as surveillance shots from high-altitude spy planes. The film was released in the United States on October 10, 2008.","Section: Plot (1):
Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a CIA case officer in Iraq, tracking a terrorist called Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul). He meets Nizar, a member of the terrorist organization who is prepared to offer information in return for asylum in North America.
Despite the objections of his boss, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), Ferris agrees to shelter Nizar. Nizar is used as a pawn to draw out the rest of his cell; when Nizar is captured, Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent his exposing the identities of Ferris and his associate, Bassam (Oscar Isaac). However, furious at Hoffman's refusal to act on the information Nizar provided, Ferris and Bassam go to search the safe house in Balad, Iraq, Nizar had told them about. Ferris observes men burning records and attempts to bluff his way in but is exposed. In the ensuing shootout and chase, Ferris and Bassam's vehicle is hit by an RPG. Ferris and some salvaged discs are rescued by helicopter, but Bassam is killed in the explosion.
Meanwhile, unknown terrorists in the UK plan to follow up on bus bombings in Sheffield with more attacks in Manchester, but they blow themselves up when the police arrive at their house. Having recovered from his injuries, Ferris is assigned to Jordan to continue searching for Al-Saleem. There, Ferris meets with and negotiates a collaboration with Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate. From the intelligence Ferris harvested from the Balad safe house, Hoffman locates an Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes (unbeknownst to Ferris) a ""side operation"" via a local agency. Ferris' CIA subordinate, Skip (Vince Colosimo), identifies the local agency asset as Ziyad Abishi.
Abishi blows his cover with a terrorist from the safe house. The terrorist flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, and Ferris chases and kills him in such a place and manner that implies the death is a random robbery. Salaam (via ""back channels"") corroborates this interpretation of killing with those who remain at the safe house. Ferris lambastes Hoffman for running ""side operations"" which he feels are interfering with and undermining the operational integrity of the primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for dog bites he suffered while eliminating the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and begins developing romantic feelings for her. In Europe the bombers strike again at an Amsterdam flower market, killing 75 people and wounding hundreds more.
Having recognized one of the men living in the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami (Kais Nashef), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unbeknownst to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Skip to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris' associate, Skip, is caught by Salaam. Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, blames Ferris' duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house, and exiles Ferris from Jordan.
Ferris returns to Hoffman in Washington, and they devise a new plan to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is motivated more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman), an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem will come out of hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait. Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan and shares his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, although Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack. He is later found beaten and killed.
Ferris goes back to his apartment and discovers that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris' having lied to him earlier. Ferris offers himself in exchange to Aisha's kidnappers and is brought to the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris.
Ferris is taken across the border to Syria, where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera, and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Salaam's security officer.
Salaam visits Ferris in the hospital, and reveals he had faked Aisha's abduction and orchestrated Ferris' capture by Al-Saleem using Karami as a go-between. Having lost the will to fight in this particular ""war"", Ferris goes off the grid and goes to see Aisha again.

It's about Islam, where we are and where we're not, and it's a very interesting, proactive, internalized view of that whole subject.
In March 2006, Warner Bros. hired screenwriter William Monahan to adapt the novel Penetration by David Ignatius into a feature film, which would be directed by Ridley Scott. In April 2007, with the novel re-titled Body of Lies and the film similarly re-titled, actor Leonardo DiCaprio was cast in the lead role. DiCaprio chose to pursue the role because he considered it a throwback to political films in the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). DiCaprio dyed his hair brown, and wore brown contacts for the role. After DiCaprio was cast, Russell Crowe was courted for a supporting role, to which he formally committed after Monahan's script was revised by Steve Zaillian, who wrote Scott and Crowe's American Gangster. Crowe gained 63 pounds to suit his role. The actor said as a result of the film's exploration of the American government and foreign policy, ""I don't think it will be very popular, but that’s never been part of my project choice process."" Mark Strong, who plays Hani Salaam, the head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) ascribed his casting to his performances in the 2005 films Syriana and Oliver Twist. The character Haani Salaam was modelled after the 2000–2005 GID chief Saad Kheir (1953–2009), whose involvement, according to the original author David Ignatius, in sharply handled interrogations without the use of torture, an encounter with a jihadist with his mother on the phone and being called the 'fingernail boss' were near accurately featured in the film.

Section: Location and design (2):
Scott sought to film in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, but the federation's National Media Council denied the director permission due to the script's politically sensitive nature. As a result, scenes set in Jordan were instead filmed in Morocco. The shoot took place over sixty-five days from September to December 2007. It was filmed in the United States and Morocco, where scenes set in ten different countries were filmed. Filming began on September 5, 2007 at the Eastern Market, Washington, D.C. Practical locations were used throughout; part of the Capitol Hill neighborhood was converted to resemble a wintry Amsterdam to film a ten- to fifteen-second car bomb explosion. Scenes set in the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia were filmed at the National Geographic offices in Gaithersburg, Maryland; both buildings were set in woodland and ""It was eerily similar in terms of architectural style,..."", said Arthur Max, the production designer, ""We were given several empty floors."" Locations in Baltimore also stood in for Manchester, England and Munich, Germany, although the final cut of the movie did not have any scenes that took place in Munich.
Production moved to Morocco, where Scott, Max and Alexander Witt, the cinematographer had filmed several times before. Their previous experience meant they ""knew every stone in the desert"" and they were allowed access to many locations, including the Ministry of Finance, which was dressed as Jordan's secret service headquarters, Casablanca airport and a military airfield. The basketball stadium in Rabat was used as the U.S. embassy in Jordan: a CIA office set was built inside the stadium, favoured because its design allowed the cameras to shoot both interior and exterior vistas, thus showing the characters looking out on people and tanks passing in the streets. A nine-week shoot also took place at CLA Studios and in the desert around the city of Ouarzazate.

Section: Cinematography (2):
Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a director of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.Scott is known for his skill at filming with multiple camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, ""Actors like multiple cameras because they’re always on-camera, so they’re always in character and not wasting time off-camera."" One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the gaffer, attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, ""Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for – he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly how he will cut it.""In line with the film's use of practical locations, the photography and design departments worked together to incorporate practical light sources such as ""lots of bare bulbs, lots of primitive fixtures"". In the climactic torture scene, filmed in an ancient, windowless prison cell outside of Rabat, they used only diegetic light: two strong torches carried by the actors playing the torturers. It was filmed with three cameras and bounce cards were used to reflect light onto the actors' faces. Just a little smoke was sprayed in to augment the atmosphere but not dull the contrast.Scott has used many gradations of lens filter in the past, but declined to do so on Body of Lies. One obtains better finesse using the digital intermediate during post-production and does not risk losing light while selecting filters during expensive on-set time. The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations in Washington and Morocco were allowed to show through.In the film, images from unmanned aerial drones show the viewer the point of view of CIA commanders in Washington. These were filmed by John Marzano (Aerial Director Of Photography) using a helicopter mounted with a Wescam 35 on the nose of a helicopter, and Cineflex's V14 surveillance system, hanging from the side. Its 1–40 zoom allowed the filmmakers to fly very high and then zoom out of Ferris strolling through a market-place, creating the film's final shot.

Section: Music (2):
The film score was composed by Marc Streitenfeld, who has now composed music for Ridley Scott for three features. He recorded the orchestral portions of his score at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers Studios. Of note is the presence of a song in the film named ""If the World"", performed by Guns N' Roses, and taken from their long-delayed Chinese Democracy album. The track plays over the beginning of the end credits, but is not included on the official film soundtrack. Streitenfeld also collaborated with Mike Patton and Serj Tankian on the song ""Bird's Eye"", which was written specially for the musical score of the film. It was not included on the soundtrack album but was released separately as a single.

Section: Critical response (2):
Body of Lies received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 55%, based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The critical consensus reads, ""Body of Lies relies too heavily on the performances of DiCaprio and Crowe to lift it above a conventional espionage thriller."" On Metacritic the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".Roger Ebert, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film three out of four stars. He praised the ""convincing"" acting and ""realistic locations and terse dialogue"" but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, ""Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible."" Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, ""The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable,"" he wrote, ""but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention."" Lou Lumenick in the New York Post wrote that, ""There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies"" and Lisa Kennedy in The Denver Post summarised: ""Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar.""Critics observed the film's adherence to conventions of the spy thriller genre; Ebert called it ""a James Bond plot"" and David Denby in The New Yorker pointed out the ""usual tropes of the genre—surveillance shots from drones, S.U.V.s tearing across the desert, explosions, scenes of torture"" but praised Scott's superior management of space and timing. While Todd McCarthy in Variety praised the initial set-up and conceit of the plot device, he criticised the formulaic approach leading to a ""cornball denouement"". A. O. Scott in The New York Times wrote that director Scott's ""professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity."" He added that he would have preferred the psychological tensions linking the three leading men were allowed develop further. Joe Neumaier wrote in the New York Daily News that the film ""aims to be up-to-the-moment – yet feels same-old, same-old.""Kennedy called the love story between DiCaprio and Farahani contrived, saying that while DiCaprio seemed more at home in those scenes, it made the film seem ""foolish"". Ebert thought the cultural context of their relationship was well established, but that it essentially existed as a convenience of the plot, to set up the unlikely conclusion.Mark Strong's performance was mentioned by several critics, with Scott calling it ""a marvel of exotic suavity and cool insinuation"" while Ebert ""particularly admired"" his aura of suave control.

Section: Box office (2):
Body of Lies earned $12.9 million on its first weekend in theatres in the United States and Canada, 40% less than expected. This placed it as the third highest earning film that weekend, behind Disney's Beverly Hills Chihuahua, which turned  out to be No. 1 with a take of $17.5 million in its second week, and Sony/Screen Gems's Quarantine, which earned $14.2 million—about $2 million more than it cost to make. A Warner Bros. executive said he was disappointed with the film's opening and attributed it to its controversial storyline, although Body of Lies fared better than previous pictures about the ""war on terrorism"" such as Rendition, In the Valley of Elah, and Lions for Lambs, which all performed well below studios' expectations. In a fourteen-week theatrical run in the United States and Canada, the film earned $39 million.Outside North America it opened reasonably well. In Australia it was the highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's earnings were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read these themes in the news media already, and there is a perception that Hollywood films are biased.Golshifteh Farahani's performance in the film resulted in trouble for Farahani from the Iranian government, being accused of being shown without a hijab.

20,Break,France,Nynamor,Netflix,,,96,,,1160525,,,,,"n Break (Netflix), a young dancer’s search for the father she never knew leads her to a gritty commune on the outskirts of Paris, and the discovery of a whole new form of expression in the underground dance battle scene. Break is director and writer Marc Fouchard’s full-length debut after his 2014 short film The Way of Tea was shortlisted for an Academy Award. The Gist: Lucie is a young dancer living in Paris. With her partner Julien, she focuses on aerial movement, and that’s how we meet her: hanging off the side of a building in a harness, practicing gravity-defying jumps and graceful twirls with Julien in preparation for their audition before the judges of a major dance company. Their moves are incredible, straight out of the reality bending, gravity-defying fight scenes in Dr. Strange, but Lucie isn’t a superhero, and an accident knocks her back to earth and into a coma.

Lucie’s accident and recovery reignites her wish to find the father she never knew, who left her mother when she became pregnant. She tracks him to St. Denis, a cement-scarred commune away from the lights of Paris, where he owns a small rooming house and brasserie. There she finds her dad, but also discovers Vincent, a young ex-con who dances in a manner Lucie’s never seen before. The dynamic blend of styles includes robotic mime combinations, sudden body maneuvers and transitions into breakdancing and other frenetic b-boy power moves. It’s transfixing, and Lucie’s hooked.

Together with Julien, Lucie begins to train at the old gymnasium that serves as the headquarters for Vincent and his friends, a motley bunch of breakers, dancers, and tumblers. She’s also indoctrinated into their underground world, a crucible where dance crews compete in freestyle battles, their furiously recombinant moves fueled by street savvy, youthful energy, and hip-hop cypher braggadocio.

While the dancer in Lucie is reinvigorated by the battles, Julien isn’t feeling it, and they split up. Lucie continues training for the audition, now informed by her new moves, and she begins to fall for Vincent. But her father doesn’t seem to want to acknowledge her, her mother is pleading with her to come home to Paris, and Lucie doesn’t yet know whether she even fits into this new world she’s discovered, whether as a person or a dancer.What Movies Will It Remind You Of? The 2018 Norwegian film Battle (2018; Netflix) is a similar coming-of-age tale about a young female dancer’s encounter with freestyle dance competitions. The Aerialist (2020; Amazon Prime) explores the life, work, and struggles of an acrobat. 2007’s Stomp the Yard includes a wealth of impressive dance sequences, and it’s never a bad idea to revisit Flashdance. Meanwhile, many of the synchronized group dance moves in Break share DNA with the basket tosses and split-lifts common in competitive cheer, a scene into which the powerful Netflix docuseries Cheer goes deep.

Performance Worth Watching: As Vincent’s best friend Malik, Slimane Nebchi (He uses only his first name professionally) is the steady heartbeat of Break. Once a member of the dance crew with Vincent, he lost the use of his legs when a difficult throw went wrong during a battle. Now he’s the only one who knows Vincent’s true heart, and serves as his conscience throughout the film. Slimane himself is a singer and songwriter in real life; he won the French version of The Voice in 2016.

Memorable Dialogue: “You’ve learned in a studio. You can tell,” Vincent tells Lucie. “No originality. You have no technique, but you have something…magnetic. That’s rare.”

Sex and Skin: There is a brief love scene, but it’s nothing too risque.

Our Take: Break is at its best when it’s battling. We are as fascinated as Lucie is as we descend into the churning mass of the crowd, hear the DJ furiously scratching, the emcee bellowing, and the crews calling each other out. “Vagabonds! Battle now!” Vincent’s pal Wiki shouts. (“Wiki” as in Wikipedia, because he’s like an encyclopedia of breakdance moves.) “We’ll waste you!” And the dance wars begin. Bodies linked together. B-boys contorting into somersaults that mutate into furious downrock and freezes. Headspins that continue uninterrupted for 30 revolutions. The athletic throws and handsprings of cheer, weaponized. It’s heady stuff. In its most kinetic moments, Break is captivating.

The roles of Lucie and Vincent are physically challenging, and Sabrina Ouazani and Kevin Mischel meet that head on. But they also have a natural chemistry, and this gives the film’s quieter moments some tingle. As coming-of-age films go, Break does stick pretty close to the formula, but it comes alive whenever it finds its way back to dance, and also features an enjoyable training montage, which is a must for any movie of its ilk. “It doesn’t matter how many times you fall,” Lucie’s father says with wisdom of a man who squandered his boxing career, did a bit behind bars, and lost his first opportunity to be in his daughter’s life. “As long as you get back up.”

Our Call: STREAM IT. Break makes the most of the key sections in a film such as this — thrilling dance sequences; the inevitable training montage — and its cast of young actors are a compelling, diverse group with a natural chemistry that keeps you invested over its more formulaic stretches.",4.5,1456, Drama ,Positive,0.952

",,"Young love is tested by illness and honesty issues in “Caught by a Wave,” a scenic Italian romance set against a sailing backdrop.

The leads are pretty and the locales romantic, but the scenario is generic and the pacing funereal in this dry-eyed weeper of rehab and regattas.

Sailing camp on the isle of Favignana is where Sara (Elvira Camarrone) meets Lorenzo (Roberto Christian). She’s a bit more confident than the other kids, more at home in a Laser racing dinghy than the newbies. He’s been to the camp many times, and is now an expert dinghy racer (29ers) and assistant instructor.

He comes on strong and cute, she plays it coy. “Let him suffer, no matter what” her BFF Barbara (Sofia Migliara) instructs (in Italian with subtitles, or dubbed into English).

But Sara has a secret, one that enters the picture the moment she cramps up one day on the water. Back home, she has another episode and we learn the truth from the doctor who puts her into rehab. Her “inevitably degenerative muscular dystrophy” has advanced. This doesn’t bode well for her future, much less any future with Lorenzo.

How long will she keep this from him?Second-unit director Massimiliano Camaiti makes the sailing scenes pretty and pretty exciting in his feature directing debut. And the script, which he co-wrote, has its touching moments. Lorenzo lost his mother as a child and taking on a relationship with doom hanging over it gives him a struggle, if less of one than Sara, who sees the future of her disease in her fellow rehab patients.

There isn’t much edge here, but teens hospitalized after a rave and a helpful aunt teaching Lorenzo how to light a cigarette aren’t elements you’d see in your typical North American teen romance.

The cute bits aren’t quite enough to merit ducking into this Netflix original. But the lovely setting and the romance might decide that for some. And who, when facing a grim future, wouldn’t want to hear something this reassuring from your first love?

Pictures,Johnny Depp Freddie Highmore David Kelly Helena Bonham Carter Noah Taylor Missi Pyle James Fox Deep Roy Christopher Lee,John August,115,Tim Burton,150000000,474968763,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 2005 American musical fantasy film directed by Tim Burton and written by John August, based on the 1964 British novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, alongside David Kelly, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Missi Pyle, James Fox, Deep Roy, and Christopher Lee. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.
Development for a second adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory began in 1991, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese, and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while actors Bill Murray, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Adam Sandler, and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.
Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents the first time since The Nightmare Before Christmas that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released to positive critical reviews and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide.","Section: Plot (1):
Charlie Bucket and his family live in poverty near the Wonka Factory. The company's owner, Willy Wonka, has long since closed his factory due to problems concerning industrial espionage committed by his jealous rivals, which led him to fire all of his employees, including Charlie's Grandpa Joe.
One day, Wonka restarts his factory and announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random Wonka Bars worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive an additional prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the arrogant Violet Beauregarde, and the ill-tempered Mike Teavee. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in Russia, Charlie finds a ten-dollar note and purchases a third Wonka Bar. The Russian ticket is revealed to be a forgery just as Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. He receives monetary offers for the ticket, but the cashier tells him to not trade it at any cost, and Charlie runs back home. At home, Charlie says that he wants to trade it for money for his family's betterment. After a pep talk from Grandpa George however, he decides to keep it and brings Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the tour.
Charlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause the other four children to give into temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour while Wonka's new employees, the Oompa-Loompas, sing a song of morality after each. All the while, Wonka reminisces on his troubled past and how his dentist father, Wilbur, strictly forbade him from consuming candy due to the potential dental risks. After sneaking a piece of candy, Wonka instantly became hooked and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned however, both his father and their house were gone. After the tour, the four eliminated children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination while Charlie learns that Wonka, now approaching retirement, intended to find a worthy heir. Since Charlie was the ""least rotten"" of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, on the condition that he leave his family behind. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.
As Charlie and his family live contently, Wonka becomes despondent, causing his company and sales to decline. He eventually turns to Charlie for advice, and he decides to help Wonka reconcile with his estranged father. During the reunion, Wonka realizes the value of family while Wilbur accepts his son for who he is and not what he does. Afterwards, Wonka allows Charlie and his family to move into the factory together.

Section: Development (2):
Author Roald Dahl disapproved of the 1971 film adaptation. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity (""Liccy""), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.Scott Frank was hired to write the screenplay in February 1999, after approaching Warner Bros. for the job. Frank, a recent Oscar-nominee for the R-rated crime film Out of Sight, wanted to work on a film that his children could enjoy. As an enthusiastic fan of the book, he intended to remain more faithful to Dahl's vision than the 1971 film had been. Nicolas Cage was under discussions for Willy Wonka, but lost interest. Gary Ross signed to direct in February 2000, which resulted in Frank completing two drafts of the screenplay, before leaving with Ross in September 2001. Both Warner Bros. and the Dahl Estate wanted Frank to stay on the project, but he faced scheduling conflicts and contractual obligations with Minority Report (2002) and The Lookout (2007).Rob Minkoff entered negotiations to take the director's position in October 2001, and Gwyn Lurie was hired to start from scratch on a new script in February 2002. Lurie said she would adapt the original book and ignore the 1971 film adaptation. Dahl's estate championed Lurie after being impressed with her work on another Dahl adaptation, a live-action adaptation of The BFG, for Paramount Pictures, which was never made (Paramount distributed the earlier 1971 film version of Charlie, and later sold the rights to WB). In April 2002, Martin Scorsese was involved with the film, albeit briefly, but opted to direct The Aviator instead. Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn wanted Tom Shadyac to direct Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka, believing the duo could make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory relevant to mainstream audiences, but Liccy Dahl opposed this.

Section: Pre-production (2):
After receiving enthusiastic approval from the Dahl estate, Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct in May 2003. Burton compared the project's languishing development to Batman (1989), which he directed, in how there had been varied creative efforts with both films. He said, ""Scott Frank's version was the best, probably the clearest, and the most interesting, but they had abandoned that."" Liccy Dahl commented that Burton was the first and only director the estate was happy with. He had previously produced another of the author's adaptations with James and the Giant Peach (1996) (also produced by Burton), and, like Roald and Liccy, disliked the 1971 film because it strayed from the book's storyline.

During pre-production Burton visited Dahl's former home in the Buckinghamshire village of Great Missenden. Liccy Dahl remembers Burton entering Dahl's famed writing shed and saying, ""This is the Buckets' house!"" and thinking to herself, ""Thank God, somebody gets it."" Liccy also showed Burton the original handwritten manuscripts, which Burton discovered were more politically incorrect than the published book. The manuscripts included a child named Herpes, after the sexually transmitted disease. Burton immediately thought of Johnny Depp for the role of Willy Wonka, who in August 2003 joined the film, his fourth collaboration with the director.Lurie's script received a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, who worked with Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He did not see the 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.Burton and August also worked together in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise he would be ""just a weird guy"". The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be a good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, ""In some ways, he's more screwed up than the kids."" Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a whiz kid, but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who would be in the background and not get in trouble.

Section: Casting (2):
Prior to Burton's involvement, Warner Bros. considered or discussed Willy Wonka with Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Leslie Nielsen, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin (all three of them were members of Monty Python), Patrick Stewart, and Adam Sandler. Dustin Hoffman and Marilyn Manson reportedly wanted the role as well. Pitt's production company, Plan B Entertainment, however, stayed on to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. Johnny Depp was the only actor Burton considered for the role, although Dwayne Johnson was Burton's second choice in case Depp was unavailable. Depp signed on without reading the script under the intention of going with a completely different approach than what Gene Wilder did in the 1971 film adaptation. Depp said regardless of the original film, Gene Wilder's characterization of Willy Wonka stood out as a unique portrayal.Depp and Burton derived their Willy Wonka from children's television show hosts such as Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), Fred Rogers, and Al Lewis from The Uncle Al Show, and Depp also took inspiration from various game show hosts. Burton recalled from his childhood that the characters were bizarre but left lasting impressions. He said, ""It was kind of a strange amalgamation of these weird children's TV show hosts."" Depp based Wonka's look (exaggerated bob cut and sunglasses) on Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour.Comparisons were drawn between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Burton disagreed with the comparisons and said Jackson, unlike Wonka, liked children. Depp said the similarities with Jackson never occurred to him. Instead, he compared Wonka to Howard Hughes due to his ""reclusive, germaphobe, controlling"" nature. Burton agreed with the similarity to Hughes. He also cited Charles Foster Kane from Citizen Kane as an inspiration for Wonka, as Kane is ""somebody who was brilliant but then was traumatized and then retreats into their own world"". Depp wanted to sport prosthetic makeup for the part and have a long, elongated nose, but Burton believed it would be too outrageous. During production, Gene Wilder, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, accused the filmmakers of only remaking the 1971 film for the purpose of money. Depp said he was disappointed by Wilder's comment, and responded that the film was not a remake, but a new adaptation of Dahl's 1964 book.The casting calls for Charlie Bucket, Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee took place in the United States and United Kingdom, while Augustus Gloop's casting took place in Germany. Burton said he sought actors ""who had something of the character in them"", and found Mike Teavee the hardest character to cast. Burton was finding trouble casting Charlie, until Depp, who had worked with Freddie Highmore on Finding Neverland, suggested Highmore for the part. Highmore had already read the book before, but decided to read it once more prior to auditioning. The actor did not see the original film adaptation, and chose not to see it until after Burton's production, so his portrayal would not be influenced.Before Adam Godley was officially cast as Mr. Teavee, Dan Castellaneta, Tim Allen, Ed O'Neill, Bob Saget, and Ray Romano were all considered for the role.It has been rumored that Gregory Peck was considered for the role of Grandpa Joe but passed away before being able to accept the role. Other actors that were considered for Grandpa Joe included Richard Attenborough, Kirk Douglas, Albert Finney, Anthony Hopkins, Paul Newman, Max von Sydow, David Warner, Christopher Lloyd and Peter Ustinov.

Section: Filming (2):
Principal photography for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory started on June 21, 2004, at Pinewood Studios in England. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman found filming somewhat difficult because they were simultaneously working on Corpse Bride. The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989). The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras. The Chocolate Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work four and a half hours a day, filming for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.

Section: Design (2):
The architecture of the Bucket family home was influenced by Burton's visit to Roald Dahl's writing hut. Like the book, the film has a ""timeless"" setting and is not set in a specific country. ""We've tried not to pinpoint it to any place,"" production designer Alex McDowell explained. ""The cars, in fact, drive down the middle of the road."" The town, whose design was shaped by the black and white urban photography of Bill Brandt, as well as Pittsburgh and Northern England, is arranged like a medieval village, with Wonka's estate on top and the Bucket shack below. The filmmakers also used fascist architecture for Wonka's factory exterior, and designed most of the sets on 360-degree sound stages, similar to cycloramas. Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ""melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future."" The ""TV Room"" was patterned after photographs from the films 2001: A Space Odyssey, Danger: Diabolik, and THX 1138. Danger Diabolik also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.

Section: Visual effects (2):
Tim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI) wherever possible. Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. ""Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots—all they do is work, work, work,"" Roy commented. ""So when it comes time to dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps.""A practical method was considered for the scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for the beginnings of the swelling scene, before the decision was made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.
Rather than rely on CGI, Burton wanted the 40 squirrels in the Nut Room to be real. The animals were trained every day for 10 weeks before filming commenced. They began their coaching while newborns, fed by bottles to form relationships with human trainers. The squirrels were each taught how to sit upon a little blue bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt. ""Ultimately, the scene was supplemented by CGI and animatronics,"" Burton said, ""but for the close-ups and the main action, they're the real thing."" Wonka's Viking boat for the Chocolate River sequence floats down a realistic river filled with 192,000 gallons of faux melted chocolate. ""Having seen the first film, we wanted to make the chocolate river look edible,"" McDowell said. ""In the first film, it's so distasteful."" The production first considered a CGI river, but Burton was impressed with the artificial substance when he saw how it clung to the boat's oars. Nine shades of chocolate were tested before Burton settled on the proper hue.

Section: Music (2):
The original music score was written by Danny Elfman, a frequent collaborator with director Tim Burton. Elfman's score is based around three primary themes: a gentle family theme for the Buckets, generally set in upper woodwinds; a mystical, string-driven waltz for Willy Wonka; and a hyper-upbeat factory theme for full orchestra, Elfman's homemade synthesizer samples and the diminutive chanting voices of the Oompa-Loompas.Elfman also wrote and performed the vocals for four songs, with pitch changes and modulations to represent different singers. The lyrics to the Oompa-Loompa songs are adapted from the original book, and are thus credited to Roald Dahl. Following Burton's suggestion, each song in the score is designed to reflect a different archetype. ""Wonka's Welcome Song"" is a maddeningly cheerful theme park ditty, ""Augustus Gloop"" a Bollywood spectacle (per Deep Roy's suggestion), ""Violet Beauregarde"" is 1970s funk, ""Veruca Salt"" is 1960s bubblegum pop / psychedelic pop, and ""Mike Teavee"" is a tribute to late 1970s hard rock (such as Queen) and early 1980s hair bands.The original motion picture soundtrack was released on July 12, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 230 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Closer to the source material than 1971's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is for people who like their Chocolate visually appealing and dark."" According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 from 40 critic reviews, the film received ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A–"" on an A+ to F scale.Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, writing ""Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka may be a stone freak, but he is also one of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood."" Roger Ebert gave an overall positive review and enjoyed the film. He was primarily impressed by Tim Burton's direction of the younger cast members, but was disappointed with Depp's performance: ""What was Depp thinking of? In Pirates of the Caribbean he was famously channeling Keith Richards, which may have primed us to look for possible inspirations for this performance."" Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's ""best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor."" Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that ""Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not get hooked on something this tasty. And how about that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack.""Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post criticized Depp's acting. ""The cumulative effect isn't pretty. Nor is it kooky, funny, eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed, throughout his fey, simpering performance, Depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip. Aside from Burton's usual eye-popping direction, the film's strenuous efforts at becoming a camp classic eventually begin to wear thin.""In 2007, Gene Wilder said he chose not to see the film. ""The thing that put me off... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like him very much... but when I saw little pieces in the promotion of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him."" In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton adaptation, he said, ""I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult."" He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying, ""I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did.""

Its cast includes Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Stormare.  It is Lawrence's directorial debut.
The film is based on DC Comics' Hellblazer comic book, with plot elements taken from the ""Dangerous Habits"" story arc (issues #41–46) and the ""Original Sins"" story arc. The film portrays John Constantine as a cynic with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. He seeks salvation from eternal damnation in Hell for a suicide attempt in his youth. Constantine exorcises demons back to Hell to earn favor with Heaven but has become weary over time. With terminal lung cancer, he helps a troubled police detective learn the truth about her twin sister's death while simultaneously unraveling a much larger and darker plot.
The character of John Constantine was introduced by comic book writer/creator Alan Moore while writing the Swamp Thing, first appearing there in June 1985. In 1988, the character was given his own comic book title, Hellblazer, published by DC Comics. The ""Dangerous Habits"" story arc was written by Garth Ennis in 1991.Constantine was theatrically released in the United States on February 18, 2005. It grossed $230.9 million worldwide against a production budget between $70–100 million.","Section: Plot (1):
In the Mexican countryside, a scavenger named Manuel finds a spearhead wrapped in a Nazi flag at the ruins of an old church. The spearhead is later revealed as the Spear of Destiny. Manuel becomes possessed and travels to the United States.
In Los Angeles, occult detective John Constantine is called in by Father Hennessy to exorcise a girl possessed by a demon trying to break through to Earth, which should not be possible under the rules of a standing wager between God and Lucifer for mankind's souls. Constantine's driver and apprentice, Chas Kramer, waits in the car as Constantine doesn't believe Chas is ready to exorcise demons. Constantine later meets with the androgynous half-angel being Gabriel. He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer caused by prolonged smoking. Gabriel declines, telling Constantine that he exorcises demons for selfish reasons and cannot buy his way into Heaven, because of the life he took.
After being assaulted by another demon, Constantine goes to Papa Midnite, a reputed witch doctor who runs a club serving as neutral ground where half-breeds do not have to conceal themselves. Midnite doesn't believe Constantine's claim of demons crossing over. Constantine leaves after exchanging hostile words with the half-demon Balthazar.
Elsewhere, a woman named Isabel Dodson commits suicide in a psychiatric hospital. Her twin sister, Detective Angela Dodson, refuses to believe that Isabel, a devout Catholic, would kill herself. Watching security footage of Isabel's suicide, Angela hears her say Constantine's name. Angela finds Constantine and asks him to help investigate her death. After they are attacked by winged demons, which Constantine believes were targeting Angela, he agrees to help.
Constantine briefly transports himself to Hell through the possession of a familiar and sees Isabel damned to eternally relive her suicide. As proof, he is able to bring back her hospital wristband. Constantine explains to Angela that he can see the true nature of the half-breeds. He committed suicide to escape his visions as a teenager and his soul was sent to Hell, but he was revived by paramedics two minutes later; for the sin of taking his own life, his soul is still condemned to go to Hell once he dies. Elsewhere, Father Hennessy investigates Isabel's corpse and finds a mysterious mark on her wrist. Balthazar drowns him in alcohol before he can inform Constantine. Constantine and Angela search Hennessy's body at the crime scene and find the symbol stabbed into Hennessy's palm.
The two examine Isabel's room in the hospital and find a clue (left on the window only revealed by Angela breathing on it) pointing to a prophecy in the Satanic Bible and enlist the help of Constantine's weapons supplier, Beeman, who informs them that the mark belongs to Lucifer's son, Mammon. The prophecy states that Mammon will attempt to claim Earth as his own kingdom. In order to cross over, Mammon requires both a powerful psychic and assistance from God. Constantine and Angela find Beeman's corpse engulfed beneath a swarm of flies.
Angela tells Constantine that Isabel, a clairvoyant and a psychic, was committed by their parents. Angela had the same gift but suppressed it, and now feels guilty that she didn't corroborate Isabel's visions, having feared the treatments Isabel was made to go through. At Angela's insistence, Constantine reawakens her psychic ability through a near-death experience. She immediately finds a clue pinpointing Balthazar as an accomplice to the plot; Constantine interrogates Balthazar, who reveals that Mammon has the Spear, stained with the blood of Christ—the assistance from God. Angela, now the psychic in place of Isabel, is abducted and possessed by an invisible entity.
Constantine convinces Midnite that the demons are breaking the rules. With Midnite's help, Constantine finds out how the Spear emerged and Angela's location. Constantine arms himself and goes to the hospital, reluctantly bringing Chas along. The two fight their way through an army of half-demons to exorcise Angela. Believing they have won, Constantine witnesses an invisible entity kill Chas, which turns out to be Gabriel. Resenting God's favoritism towards humans, Gabriel plans to unleash Hell on Earth to weed out those deemed ""unworthy"" of God's love. Gabriel casts Constantine from the room and prepares to use the Spear to cut Mammon free from Angela.
Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to personally collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him and Gabriel's part in the plan. Confronted by Lucifer, Gabriel threatens to 'smite' him in God's honor; however, the attack against Lucifer comes up short, revealing to both Gabriel and Lucifer that Gabriel no longer has divine protection. Lucifer proceeds to burn Gabriel's wings, making Gabriel mortal. Lucifer banishes Mammon back to Hell and grants Constantine a wish out of gratitude; Constantine asks that Isabel be released to Heaven. Lucifer complies but realizes too late that he cannot take Constantine to Hell; by selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Constantine begins to float upwards, but Lucifer, infuriated, intervenes before Constantine can be fully taken by healing Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer by pulling out the tumors in his lungs, hoping he will eventually damn himself again.
Angela and Constantine depart, leaving the now-human Gabriel. Sometime later, Constantine, now making an effort to quit smoking, entrusts the Spear to Angela and in a post-credits scene visits Chas's grave, where Chas appears in an angelic form and ascends into the night sky.

Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had developed the film as far back as 1997. In 1999, Paul Hunter was attached to direct, followed by Tarsem Singh in 2001. Warner Bros. hoped Singh could begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage attached to star in the lead role but Singh ended up dropping out, a move that inspired dueling lawsuits from Tarsem and Warners. Keanu Reeves became attached in 2002. Alan Moore, original creator of John Constantine, had been disappointed by the previous adaptations of his other comics From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, refused credit for the film and asked that his royalties be distributed among the other creators.
Constantine was written using some elements from Garth Ennis's ""Dangerous Habits"" story arc (issues #41–46) and others, such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite, from the Original Sins trade paperback. The film changed several aspects of the source material, including a number of cosmetic changes to the lead character's appearance, e.g., Reeves played the role with his natural accent and hair color whilst the original character was intentionally drawn to resemble English musician Sting and originally came from Liverpool. The film was also set in Los Angeles; the director pointed out that the comic book was not exclusively set in London either.Other differences to the character were made, such as giving him the psychic ability to see ""half-breeds"" as they truly are. That ability, in the film, is what caused him to attempt suicide and which led to his damnation rather than his role in summoning a demon that killed a young girl. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was also amended; Lucifer saves the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at falling rather than being tricked into doing so as was seen in the comic book. Scenes with actress Michelle Monaghan as Constantine's lover, a half-breed demon named Ellie based on the succubus Ellie in the Hellblazer comics, were cut from the film to make Constantine more of a lonely character.The film's title was changed from Hellblazer to Constantine to avoid confusion with the Clive Barker Hellraiser films. The comics series itself was originally to be titled Hellraiser but was also retitled to avoid confusion with the film, released the previous year.

Director Lawrence decided to base the idea of Hell ""on the geography of what's around us now."" He further explained:

That was actually a combination of me and the visual effects supervisor and the production designer sitting down and sort of coming up with the biological growth that's growing all over the cars and what that looks like and the color palette. And we started to look at the nuclear test films from the 1940s of the nuclear blasts and just decided that it would be great if the landscape was not only violent with these creatures, but also the atmosphere. So we decided that it was kind of an eternal nuclear blast except nothing ever really gets obliterated because it's eternal and it's constantly going.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 46% based on the reviews of 224 critics and an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's consensus states: ""Despite solid production values and an intriguing premise, Constantine lacks the focus of another spiritual shoot-em-up, The Matrix."" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, the film holds a score of 50 out of 100 based on the reviews of 41 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".Richard Corliss of Time magazine called it ""a one-of-a-kind hybrid: a theological noir action film"". In crediting the actors, he specifically cited Keanu Reeves' ability to ""retain his charisma in [a] weird-silly moment"" in addition to the performances of Tilda Swinton whom he referred to as ""immaculately decadent"". He also praised Francis Lawrence's usage of a significant number of camera locations and angles. He was, however, critical of the movie's climax, referring to it as ""irrevocably goofy"".
Ella Taylor of LA Weekly wrote, ""Constantine, which opts in the end for what I can only describe as a kind of supernatural humanism, is not without its spiritual satisfactions."" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles—he infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity.""Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave the film three stars out of five, stating that ""the film (barely) succeeds, thanks to impressive visuals, the idea of an uncaring God wagering with Satan for souls, and two immensely enjoyable scenes (one with Weisz, one with Stormare) in which Reeves actually plays his character as the cynical asshole he really is.""Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News gave the film a 2.5 out of 5, stating, ""For all its spiritual angst, Constantine is about as silly as fantasies get."" Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun also gave the film a 2 out of 5, stating, ""It all comes off as a case of filmmakers wanting to have their communion wafer and eat it, too."" Desson Thomson, a writer for The Washington Post, had similar sentiments of the film, specifically panning the film's distancing from the comic book upon which it is based:

If you are a fan of the Hellblazer comic book series, on which this movie is based, you'll definitely need a distraction. The relation between Constantine and its source material is, at best, superfluous. The disparity starts with the original John Constantine (Reeves's character) being from Liverpool, England. Reeves from the city of John and Paul? As if.
Leonard Maltin's annual publication Movie Guide gives the film a BOMB rating, describing it as ""dreary, to put it mildly"".
Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, panning the depiction of Hell (""a post-nuclear Los Angeles created by animators with a hangover""), the premise of the film itself (""You would think that God would be the New England Patriots of this contest, but apparently there is a chance that Satan could win.""), plot holes, inconsistencies, and general actions depicted throughout the film. He was not particularly critical of the film's acting, only mentioning it by stating, ""Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen Hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking."" He added it to his list of ""most hated"" films.

Pictures,Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter Tracey Ullman Joanna Lumley Christopher Lee,John August Caroline Thompson Pamela Pettler,77,Mike Johnson Tim Burton,40000000,118090836,"Corpse Bride (also known as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride) is a 2005 stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton with a screenplay by John August, Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel. The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny Depp leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voices Emily, the titular bride. Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (the previous two films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). This is also the first stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died in a car crash during production along with Pixar's Cars.
The film was a critical and commercial success. Although the film won the National Board of Review for Best Animated Feature, the film was nominated for the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which also starred Bonham Carter. The film won the Annie Awards Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement in 2006, where it was also nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Character Design, and Best Direction. It was shot with Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the 35mm film cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).","Section: Plot (1):
Victor Van Dort, the son of nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the neglected daughter of impoverished aristocrats, prepare for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's family (""According to Plan""). Although they fall in love instantly, the nervous Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows and clumsily setting Lady Everglot's dress on fire. Fleeing to a nearby forest, he practices his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on a root. However, the root is revealed to be the finger of a dead woman named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife, and spirits him away to the Land of the Dead.
During his time with her, Victor learns that Emily was murdered years ago by an unnamed perpetrator, on the night of her elopement, and he stole the family jewels she had brought (""Remains of the Day""). Emily reunites Victor with his long deceased dog, Scraps, and they bond. Desperate to return to Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into returning them to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage. Victor, feeling guilty for tricking Emily, asks the bride to wait in the forest. He successfully reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and, feeling betrayed and hurt, drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead (""Tears to Shed""). Victoria quickly tries to tell her parents of Victor's situation, but neither believe her and assume he has left her. Against her will, they decide to marry her to a presumed-wealthy visitor named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.
After reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily, learning that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows in the Land of the Living and drink a deadly poison in order to join her in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head ""upstairs"" (""The Wedding Song""), where the town erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until everyone recognizes their departed loved ones, and joyously reunite. The chaos causes a panicked Barkis to expose his own poor financial standing and his intentions to marry Victoria only for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him.
Victoria follows everyone to Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria her chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily reunites Victor and Victoria, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria. Emily recognizes him as her previous fiancé and reveals he was also her murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to protect Victoria, and Emily intervenes to save Victor's life. Barkis mockingly toasts Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison that Victor nearly took, causing him to die and allowing the dead – who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living – to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now freed from her torment, frees Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring, allowing him to marry Victoria, whom she throws her wedding bouquet to. As she steps into the moonlight, she fades away into hundreds of butterflies and flies into the sky, finding peace, as Victor and Victoria watch and embrace.

Section: Development (2):
The film is based on a 19th-century Russian-Jewish folktale, which Joe Ranft introduced to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: ""In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage as close as possible to how I thought he wanted it.""

Section: Filming (2):
The film was originally supposed to have been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: ""One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew that we were going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics.""Animation took place at 3 Mills Studios in East London. A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when production began, but that number had tripled by the end of production. The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics. The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets. The three primary characters—Victor, Victoria and Corpse Bride—were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces. The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera. A total of 32 cameras were used on the film. Each camera was outfitted with a ""grabber"" system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short ""reel"" of the shot being produced to check their work.The film's images were stored on a 1GB image card that was capable of holding approximately 100 frames of animation. Eight roving camera teams—each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues—worked with the animators to set up shots. Each camera team had a ""lighting station"" workstation—comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing—to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images. Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and ""grabber"" computer/camera system to check their work. The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: ""We shot as close to a 1:1 film ratio [one take per shot] as we could because there was no time for reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process—as many ways as needed—to get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film.""Co-director Johnson would go over each scene with the animators, sometimes acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a ""dope sheet""—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key ""hits"". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on ""2s"" or ""4s"" (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: ""The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in and see how it played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot."" The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of ""data wranglers."" Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a ""color cube."" Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: ""The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it."" The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.

Section: Visual effects (2):
Visual effects were delivered by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and were applied to the 1,000 or so shots in the film, though most of the effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: ""The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at.""In a 2005, interview with About.com, Burton spoke about the differences between directing  Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: ""The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process."" He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: ""It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might have been a little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [together]. They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [Finney] and Joanna [Lumley] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other.""

","Tim Burton has a face like a crumpled paper bag, while Johnny Depp possesses the androgynous beauty of an errant angel. Yet the two have collaborated so often over the years that Depp now seems like Burton's on-screen alter ego.

He has starred in four Burton films - Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. And now he voices the lead role in Burton's animated feature, Corpse Bride, opposite the director's wife, Helena Bonham Carter, with whom Burton lives in London, rejoicing in the fact that he's been able to make his home in a city where it rains a lot.

Inspired by a Russian folk tale, Corpse Bride is the story of Victor (Depp) and Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson), who enter into an engagement arranged by their respective parents on a brutally pragmatic basis.

Victoria's mother and father, Maudeline and Finis Everglot, are old money - or were before they spent it all - while Victor's, Nell and William Van Dort, are scheming vulgarians sitting on a fortune earned from the canned fish business. So it's a simple transaction - a smooth step up the social ladder in exchange for a swift injection of cash. What neither side has bargained for is that the betrothed couple fall in love at first sight - which happens to be at the wedding rehearsal.

Unhappily, however, such a rush of feeling does nothing for Victor's already strained nerves and he keeps stumbling over the marriage vows. Hoping that a stroll will help, he wanders into a nearby wood, where he temporarily parks the wedding ring on what he thinks is a twig while he runs over the troublesome words yet again. Bad move. The twig is actually a skeletal finger belonging to the Corpse Bride (Bonham Carter), who promptly claims him as her own and whisks him down to the Underworld.

Such a Gothic tale is very much in the Burton style - as is the fact that the dead have all the fun. Down below is one long party, full of colour, music and movement, while upstairs is a study in grey skies and even heavier brown furniture.

Burton himself says it was not so much the story as his love of puppetry and stop-motion animation which attracted him to the idea. But the painstaking business of supervising the animation, which involves the frame-by-frame manipulation and filming of the puppets, was done by his co-director, Mike Johnson, and it's marvellous.

Every animated film these days seems to come replete with at least one innovation. And this one has two. The puppets' faces are moulded from some super-supple compound of foam and silicone, made all the more malleable by a set of gears placed inside each head to produce such tiny movements that every raised eyebrow or dimpling half-smile takes on an endearing spontaneity.

The Corpse Bride herself is a tattered but gallant figure still possessing poignant remnants of her former beauty. She may be falling apart but she regards each new sign of her disintegration as nothing more than an irritating inconvenience.

As usual, the voice tracks were recorded before the animation was done and, along with Danny Elfman's typically droll score, help to set the tone. Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney are all honking vowels and booming consonants as the monstrously snobbish Everglots, while we have Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse as the no-nonsense Van Dorts.

""Do you suppose your father and I like one another?"" Mrs Van Dort trumpets at the cowed Victor when he dares to express a reservation about marrying someone he's never seen.

The dead are much more understanding. The Corpse Bride, for example, is an unquiet soul only because she's still brooding on her betrayal at the hands of the treacherous bridegroom who murdered her for her money. We feel for her in a way which wasn't quite possible with the spooks from Burton's last foray into stop-motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas. As for the rest of the dead, they're a uniformly cheery lot, their motto: ""Why go up there when people are dying to get down here?"" All in all, it's what you would ordinarily call an uplifting experience.",7.3,247743," Animation, Drama, Family",Positive,0.883
25,Coven,United States,Thriller Films,,,,92,,,,,,,,"At the American Horror Story panel that was part of August’s Television Critics’ Association press tour, the show’s executive producer talked of a “feminist theme” pervading the third season of the show. After a first season in which women were terrorized, murdered, stalked, raped, impregnated with devil babies, tortured by a killer abortionist, and imprisoned for life in a haunted mansion; and a second in which they dealt with most of that plus nuns and aliens, yeah, sure, bring on the feminism.
 
And indeed, American Horror Story: Coven indeed has a lot of potential to be more feminist than its predecessors. Witchcraft, after all, has historically been associated with women whose talents, personalities, and life choices didn’t jibe with those of the status quo, and the horrible things that were done in the name of purging communities of witches were at heart an expression of fear—fear of women who don’t conform, fear of women who have no use for the usual institutions of male power, fear of women who can make shit happen.

It’s shaping up to be a witchy TV season in general, with the soapy Lifetime drama Witches of East End joining AHS: Coven in putting spellcasters front and center, and the sheer number of amazing actors who’ve joined up with creator Ryan Murphy’s repertory company is reason enough to watch. Along with Murphy regulars like Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe, and Taissa Farmiga, AHS: Coven also features Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, Gabourey Sidibe, Patti LuPone, Frances Conroy, and Christine Ebersole. And it’s definitely off to a roaring start: Last week’s premiere episode of Coven was the series’ most watched, with 5.54 million viewers tuning in.

If you already love witches and/or the larger American Horror Story concept, you’re already watching. If not, you may be wondering both whether it’s worth your precious pop-culture time and energy, and whether those claims of a feminist theme were more than hollow hype. Though only two episodes have aired, we’ve collected  a series of points and counterpoints.Point: Witches are fucking cool. After all, who among us has not wanted to employ some magic in our lives? From benevolent acts of clairvoyance to more sinister turns in the web of the dark arts, AHS: Coven pays respect to the idea that magic need not always be used for evil. And when it is—when, for instance, a character who’s recently been drugged and gang-raped in a frat house flips a bus contained the rapists—we’re meant to feel some satisfaction that at least in this fictional world, survivors can triumph in ways that real-world survivors often cannot.

Counterpoint: Witches are cool, but rehashing past plot points with some kind of witchy twist just makes viewers think this show is obsessed with evil pregnancies and rape. In just the first two episodes of AHS: Coven, you’ll be reminded that series creator Ryan Murphy has some pet subjects. Oh, there’s a woman struggling with infertility who is reluctant—but quickly talked into—using magic to conceive? I wonder if something super untoward will happen in her uterus that will make her wish she’d stuck it out for a round of plain old in vitro! And what’s that you say? There’s that aforementioned depiction of a drugging and gang rape? Well, that’s so commonplace by now in American Horror Story that it won’t even make it into BuzzFeed’s roundup of the “16 Most WTF Moments from the American Horror Story:Coven Premiere.” Etc.
 
Point: AHS: Coven has a large, mostly female cast of characters, and you’ll want to see more of them. The nominal lead, offering viewers a fish-out-of-water introduction to Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies in New Orleans, is Zoe (Taissa Farmiga), whose parents failed to tell her she was a witch before she discovered it the hard way—by accidentally killing her boyfriend during sex. The mysterious wraith who comes to spirit her away is played by Frances Conroy, channeling Grace Coddington and being generally awesome. The young sister-witches she meets at the yawning white mansion that houses the school all have special powers to rival Zoe’s killer vagina—Madison (Emma Roberts) is telekinetic, Nan (Jamie Brewer) is clairvoyant, and Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) is a self-described “human voodoo doll.” In a parallel storyline that converges in the second episode, we meet Misty (Lily Rabe), a young woman in rural Lousiana whose ability to revive a dead bird at an actual revival meeting gets her accused of necromancy and burned at the stake. In other words, ladies be witchin’. 

Counterpoint: There’s a large, mostly female cast of characters. But women, amirite? So far—and again, it’s only been two episodes—the women fit neatly into two categories. The “evil and awful” category includes Delphine LaLaurie, a New Orleans society lady whom we meet in 1834, when she is doing unspeakable things to the slaves in her employ “because I can.” (The first 15 minutes of the first episode are made even more sickening when you find out that they are based on true events.)

Less across-the-board evil is Madison, a former child star who pettily killed a film director by dropping a light on his head but who now traffics in a general ennui that occasionally bubbles over into contempt for her peers at Miss Robichaux’s. And then there’s Fiona Goode, whom we’ll get to in a second. In the “boring pushover” category are Zoe and her headmistress Cordelia Foxx, both of whom seem essentially secure in themselves yet manage to display almost no spine when pressured to do something like build a Frankenstein out of dead frat boys or do black-magic babymaking.

Point: Jessica Lange plays a badass older witch who is called “The Supreme,” either because she is the most powerful witch around or because she got into a slap fight with Diana Ross and handily dispatched her while humming “Stop! In the Name of Love.” Since coming to live with her daughter, school headmistress Cordelia, and the four young witches of Miss Robichaux’s, she’s already hurled a couple of the ladies against a wall, dug up the long-buried evildoer LaLaurie, wiped clean the minds of two meddling police detectives, and dropped a handful of bitchtastic bon mots on whoever happens to be around, all in sky-high heels. Get her some more scenery to chew, ‘cause she’s running out.

Counterpoint: Lange’s character is, so far, pretty one-note. And, also, pretty ageist. AHS loves itself some ballsy women of a certain age, and Lange is the cappo di tutti, having previously appeared in AHS as variations on the same sassy, sexy, and straight-talking character. As Fiona, she has “getting her way in life” pretty well locked down by dint of witchcraft, which leaves plenty of time for her main obsession of not looking her age. It’s a fixation which in the first episode involves demanding increasingly large doses of an experimental rejuvenating serum from a cute male scientist, sucking the very life from said scientist once he threatened to cut off her supply, and keening at herself in a mirrored apartment while blowing rails and vamping around to the Iron Butterfly classic “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.”

It’s no coincidence that Fiona’s need to look and feel younger is juxtaposed with scenes of the slave-torturing Delphine LaLaurie daubing her face with a mixture of blood and pancreas that she believes will keep her face youthful—vanity, and more specifically the abject fear of aging, is a woman’s sin that has been the basis for more than a few horror movies. And now that Fiona has actually made the acquaintance of two immortal people—the damned-to-eternal-life LaLaurie, and Marie Laveau, the voodoo priestess responsible for said damning—we’re presumably about to see her pay a price for that vanity.

Point: If you like X-Men, you might like this season. The us-versus-them premise that undergirds AHS:Coven is that witches can and do live quietly among the citizenry, but when she shit comes down they need to make themselves scarce. Zoe’s parents never told her about the witch blood that runs through her family line; they simply hoped those powers would never manifest in her. Cordelia is the Professor X of the school, content to mix potions and murmur spells in her garden while the world goes on around her. Her mother, however, has her inner Magneto summoned by televised footage of a witch-burning, and decides that she’s tired of spell casters playing by the rules  of a society that would destroy them given the smallest chance. (For True Blood fans, this makes her the Russell Edgington of AHS, and the fact that Denis O’Hare plays the mute butler of Miss R.’s is just gravy.)

Counterpoint: You might also like this season if you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. O’Hare’s character is essentially Riff Raff. And when witches Madison and Zoe try to reassemble/reanimate Zoe’s dead crush, Kyle, from a series of disembodied arms and legs, it’s just a gorier version of Rocky rising from the table in a gold-lamé bikini to monosyllabically thrash around. It’s cheesy, is what I’m saying, as will be the subsequent scenes of Zoe trying to access the former sweetness in the grunting monster she’s created.

(Side note: During the reassembly process, I’m pretty sure the lower torso the women found for FrankenKyle was…Ken-doll style. Did anyone else notice this? Is the idea that since Zoe can’t have sex with her formerly-dead crush without re-killing him anyway, he might as well be penis-free? Or is there something more complex and beyond gender going on here?)

Point: If you like second-wave feminist history, you also might like this season. The interactions between Cordelia and Fiona at Miss Robichaux’s are something of a distillation of the tension inherent in many social movements—the inclination to assimilate, to blend in, to go along to get along versus the drive to demand visibility on your own terms, to not demand your own plate of equality but instead smash the whole dinner service. Cordelia purports to be running a tidy haven of would-be assimilation, but in fact, she’s just hiding her students away. (And there seems to be a definite lack of structure, what with the girls’ extended trips to the morgue for reanimation purposes and her own midday snake-and-fire sex rituals.) And Fiona is determined to break the girls out and put their powers in public view; in encouraging the girls to wear black and hone their skills, she’s spoiling for a showdown with a world of adversaries. It’s liberal witching against radical witching, and, as with feminism, it almost doesn’t matter which one prevails—because, to their as-yet-unseen opponents, they’re all the same.

Counterpoint: Like second-wave feminist history, AHS: Coven is also pretty white. And its attempts at diversity are… well, I’m sure someone involved in the show would probably claim something like “irony” to describe them, as this isn’t the first time the show has let the casual racism fly. There’s Queenie, of course, whose character has been fleshed out only inasmuch as we know she really likes fried chicken. And there’s Marie Laveau, whom we met in the first episode as a powerful New Orleans voodoo priestess, and who in her current, immortal incarnation, runs a weave-and-braids shop in the 9th Ward called Cornrow City, where Fiona tracks her down.

That Fiona feels comfortable with white supremacy is clear, because she wastes no time in insulting Laveau while the woman is literally holding a hot flatiron next to her head. The two are clearly equally powerful—and Laveau has the immortality Fiona desperately craves—so what gives, Fiona? Oh, yes. Racism. With the unapologetic LaLaurie on the scene, and with both Laveau and Queenie invoking the name Tituba to cement their lineage in historic witchcraft, hopefully AHS can find ways to make the racial dimensions of witchcraft something other than a side note.

Point: Misty Day, the bird-reviving witch, has regenerated herself after being burned at the stake by her own church congregation and now lives in a swamp shack, enacting vengeance on alligator poachers, helping Zoe out with her Frankenboyfriend problems, and listening to Stevie Nicks.

Counterpoint: None. This is unassailably great. You do you, Misty. I’ll be watching.",6.3,2454, Horror,Positive,0.592

Scodelario and Pepper joined the cast in July 2018, with other actors being added later that summer. Principal photography began in August 2018 and wrapped in September 2018.
The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2019, by Paramount Pictures. It grossed $91.5 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the performance by Scodelario.","Section: Plot (1):
Aspiring swimmer Haley Keller receives a call from her sister Beth, who informs her that Category 5 Hurricane Wendy is on its way to Florida, and advises her to get out of the state. Concerned for the safety of her estranged father, Dave, Haley goes to check on him at his condo, but finds it empty. She decides to check their old family home in Coral Lake, which he supposedly sold years ago. She goes against the instructions of Beth's ex-boyfriend Wayne, who is now a member of the Florida Police Department, not to enter Coral Lake as it is flooding quickly.
At the house, Haley descends into the crawl space underneath the house with the help of the family dog Sugar, eventually finding her father unconscious. As she tries to drag him out, her exit is cut off by large alligators that Dave believes got into the house via a storm drain. The alligators are too large to fit under the pipes in the crawl space, allowing Haley and Dave to find safety at the back of the crawl space.
As the hurricane intensifies and the house begins to flood, Haley attempts to navigate around the alligators to retrieve her dropped phone, but is ambushed by two alligators that destroy the phone and injure her leg. She tries to navigate around the basement and notices three people looting a nearby gas station. She attempts to draw their attention by activating her car's alarm, but all three are devoured by alligators. Later, Wayne and his partner Pete arrive at the old house in search of Haley and her father. Wayne heads into the house to look for them while Pete is ambushed and ripped apart by a swarm of alligators after the boat's engine gets tangled by debris. Wayne locates them as they warn him of the dangers in the basement. Wayne tries to radio Pete for assistance, but he is pulled into the basement by an alligator. Haley tries to save Wayne, but the alligator drags him underwater and devours him. In a last-ditch effort to escape, Haley swims to the storm drain where she discovers that the alligators have made their nest and laid eggs, while Dave kills another alligator with a shovel.
Haley successfully kills one alligator using a gun she retrieves from Wayne's body, shooting down the alligator's throat as it nearly bites her hand off. She then swims through the storm drain and out into the flooded street, and makes it into the house to crow-bar the living room floor open, saving Dave from drowning in the basement. Outside, Haley, Dave and Sugar carefully make their way onto a boat, just as the eye of the hurricane moves over the neighborhood. The floodwaters break the nearby levees, flooding Coral Lake even more and crashing them back into the house, where they get separated.
While Dave and Sugar make their way up the stairs, Haley navigates around the kitchen and uses a discarded police radio to broadcast a distress signal to authorities. Dave is attacked by one of the alligators and loses his right arm. Meanwhile, Haley manages to trap one alligator in the shower. She attempts to flag down a rescue helicopter from an upstairs bedroom but is attacked by another alligator, which attempts to drown her in a death roll. While Dave and Sugar escape to the attic, Haley stabs the alligator in the eye with a flare. She joins her dad and Sugar on the roof, narrowly avoiding being mauled by a fourth alligator before it gets swept away. Haley lights a flare and flags down the rescue helicopter as Dave proudly watches.

On May 1, 2018, Paramount Pictures announced Alexandre Aja would direct the film with Kaya Scodelario starring. Principal photography began in August 2018 in Belgrade, Serbia, and wrapped up the following month. The visual effects were provided by Rodeo FX and supervised by Thomas Montminy Brodeur and Keith Kolder.Scodelario found the shoot ""the most physically demanding"" of her career: ""I was broken at the end of every day. We were shooting 16- to 18-hour days. I was on set all day, every day. I lost about 12 pounds shooting the movie, but I gained some of it in muscle, which I was quite impressed with. I broke a finger; I came home every day bruised, bloodied and cut open."" She has spoken of how she ""beefed up"" her character as much as she could, eschewing makeup and playing most of the film in her bare feet, explaining: ""I fought to have her barefoot... I didn’t want protection on my feet. As a girl who’s a swimmer, she’s going to wear flip-flops and once she has to crawl around, she’s going to kick them off.""There was a lengthy debate within the creative team about whether the dog should live or die or perhaps sacrifice itself.

It was released on 26 February 2021 by Netflix.","Section: Plot (1):
Adri is a successful journalist for an entertainment magazine. On a night out with his friends, he meets Carla, who is spontaneous and impulsive. She seduces him to a one-night stand and insists they can never see each other again. They go to a hotel where they crash a wedding reception and have sex in the bridal suite, before Carla abruptly leaves.
Adri, now smitten with Carla, insists on finding her. He is led to a mental hospital where he sees Carla is a patient. Thinking she was happy to see him too, Adri hatches a plan to obtain her number by being admitted since unrequested visitors are not allowed. When inside, he finds Carla again, but she is shocked and angry at his presence. Upset, Adri tries to leave, but the staff stop him as they think he is actually mentally ill. He claims he is a journalist and his admittance was only for an article, but they do not believe him. Adri's friend attempts to get him out, to no avail. Before she leaves, he writes her a demeaning article about the mental hospital to submit to his boss.
Knowing he wants to escape, Adri's kind-hearted schizophrenic roommate, Saul, explains that, along with behavioral improvements, the only way to leave is to be friendly with other patients, as peer evaluations play a role in one's release. Adri meets the others, including Martha who has depression due to her Tourette's, Victor who has OCD and Tina who is delusional. Martha has a huge crush on Victor, but is too insecure to tell him due to her tics. Adri offers to help Martha muster up the courage to confess her feelings. In return, he expects good evaluations from them.
Saul asks Adri to pretend they are both doctors when his young daughter visits, as her stepfather disapproves of his disorder. While posing as a doctor, Adri bails an uncomfortable Carla out of a visit from her parents. However, she still treats him coldly. Adri finally convinces Martha to seduce Victor with a pickup line, which fails until Carla steps in and tells her to admit her feelings bluntly, which goes well. Carla reveals to Adri that she is bipolar. She has episodes of extreme euphoria where she does things for fun without thinking of the consequences, like the night they met. She also has episodes of severe depression and frequent mood swings.
Saul is deeply upset to discover his ex-wife's husband does not want his daughter to visit anymore. When Saul is missing, Adri realizes that he has jumped off the third floor and enlists the help of Carla to find him. The two discover Saul hysterical and on the way to take his daughter. Adri tries to talk him out, but Carla manages to calm him down. During a conversation with Carla, Adri promises she will get better and live normally on her own.
He begins bonding with everyone including Carla, and the two start dating. Saul's ex starts bringing his daughter's to visit again, without her husband, and he finally shares his illness with her. As Adri and Carla grow closer, she stops taking her medicine as she believes she is getting better, but her mood swings have become more intense. One night, Adri finds Carla behaving erratically on the ledge of the roof. He manages to safely pull her down, but confesses to the staff that she has been off her medication. Upset with his betrayal, Carla refuses to see him again.
Adri's article is published and has circled around the hospital. As a result, everyone starts to despise him for his negative depictions of mental health, which he regrets. The hospital director, now realizing that Adri was telling the truth, allows him to leave. She also tells him that the institution helps people learn how to live with their disorders, not pretend they do not have it to please others.
After returning to work, Adri writes another article about his time at the hospital, destigmatizing mental disorders and declaring his love for Carla, much to her disdain. Carla convinces Martha, Victor, Tina and Saul to help her break out and find Adri to confront him. At his workplace, Adri professes his love for Carla, despite the severity of her mental illness. The two share a kiss and embark on another spontaneous night together. Afterwards, Adri drops Carla back at the hospital where she finally gives him her number and he promises to call as soon as she is released. A teary-eyed Carla re-enters the institution.

",,"What always ruins great nights? The morning after!” And with that, Crazy About Her (Netflix) doses the classic one night stand romantic comedy with a cocktail of clinical hijinks and character-driven ensemble dramedy. An unlikely turn, certainly. But in this film, it’s just crazy enough to work. The Gist: Adri is a swaggering writer out on the town with his friends when he meets a woman by chance. They flirt, seem to connect instantly. “I made a bet with my friends that I could pick you up!” she tells him, and gestures to a table of ladies nearby. But since we know she arrived alone on a motorcycle, the spontaneity that lives in this woman’s eyes is as much ours as it is Adri’s. But after they crash a wedding and pilfer some fancy time alone in the bridal suite, Adri is literally left in the dust, the leather jacket she left behind his only link to the mystery girl on a motorcycle.

Adri mopes around for a few days, lovelorn, but also torn because he usually lives and breathes for one night stands. Then he finds a clue, a prescription stuffed into the jacket’s inside pocket, a name, and an address. And here’s where the mystery deepens, because Carla’s home address is a mental health facility. Adri sees her through the locked ward doors, calls out. She only smiles impishly. But this guy is smitten, undeterred, and enlivened by Carla’s spontaneous spirit. His plan? Commitment. “What I want is to get into a psychiatric center,” he tells the pliant doctor his friends find for him. “I need you to sign a report saying you have treated me as your patient.” The doc is taken aback. That’s immoral! It’ll also cost 1,000 euros.

Once on the inside the facility, Carla isn’t quite as ready to fall for Adri’s romantic antics. He also can’t leave, and it turns out commitment isn’t what it was cracked up to be. But as the residents’ various mental afflictions color his time inside the facility, Adri learns a little about people’s true nature — even, you know, crazy people — and gradually starts to crack Carla’s hardened shell.What Movies Will It Remind You Of? 1988’s The Dream Team is a terrifically zany ensemble comedy with its share of melancholic notes, tracking the misadventures of a group of mental health facility patients (including Michael Keaton and Christopher Lloyd)  loose on the streets of New York City. And while its setting and tone doesn’t match, the 2015 psychological horror series Fortitude is one of the finer recent examples of a varied ensemble facing down its individual demons.

Performance Worth Watching: As Saul, Adri’s roommate/guide to the facility and its eccentric cross-section of inhabitants, Luis Zahera is a conspiracy theorist (his favorite response to a query is “I can neither confirm nor deny that”), but also a man who trapped in the facility for much less flippant reasons than Adri. There’s a good bit of Robert De Niro’s deadpan CIA retiree from Meet the Parents going on in Zahera’s performance.

Memorable Quotes: “Are you crazy?” “We’re crazy, but we’re not fucking stupid.” “We might be deranged, but we can still hear you” — From its title on through to the dialogue between Adri and the facility’s full-time residents, Crazy About Her gets a lot of mileage out of the dynamic between “crazy,” crazy crazy, and human being.

Sex and Skin: Carla and Adri’s night of passion in the bridal suite has its share of skin.

Our Take: With the natural chemistry of the Seth Rogen-like Alvaro Cervantes as Adri and Susana Abaitua as Carla out front to lead us through its unlikely shift from romantic comedy to an ensemble essay on the sanctity of the human condition, Crazy About Her remains buoyant even as it probes the serious side of mental health issues like Tourette Syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and manic depression. “Do I seem normal to you?” Carla asks Adri when they first meet, and even then we sense her deeper meaning. What Adri considers her reckless elan, the flighty stuff rom-coms are built from, is actually one of Carla’s manic episodes, the “debut” of which was her 13-year-old self’s attempt to travel alone to London to see Pulp. As Adri learns more about her, he also begins to understand that what he loves in Carla can exist both as joyous spontaneity and something more clinical. Either way, it’s part of who Carla is.

Like the recent Andy Samberg-Cristin Miloti outing Palm Springs, Crazy About Her enjoys trolling the format it’s chosen for itself. Even though the rom-com frame is bent and broken almost immediately in favor of a heavier center, it also enjoys piecing the frame back together for the film’s big finish, where all the players unite in a full-throated emotional showdown. “I don’t need you to save me from you,” Adri tells his manic true love. “I want to be with you.” Crazy About Her‘s recognition of the romantic comedy form as just a frame waiting to be torn off the wall is where it becomes crazy like a fox.

Our Call: STREAM IT. Crazy About Her has date night energy with the juice of an ensemble dramedy hiding inside. Like most everyone in this world, there’s a lot more going on underneath the surface.",6.6,3185,"Comedy,Romance",Positive,0.618

Set in May 1940, it stars Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill and is an account of his early days as prime minister during the Second World War and the May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, while Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht swept across Western Europe and threatened to defeat the United Kingdom. The German advance leads to friction at the highest levels of government between those who would make a peace treaty with Adolf Hitler, and Churchill, who refused. The film also stars Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Ben Mendelsohn, Stephen Dillane, and Ronald Pickup.
The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on 1 September 2017, and it was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. It began a limited release in the United States on 22 November 2017, followed by general release on 22 December, and was released on 12 January 2018 in the United Kingdom.

At the 71st British Academy Film Awards, it received nine nominations including Best Film and Outstanding British Film.","Section: Plot (1):
In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party colleagues he wants Lord Halifax as his successor, but Halifax does not feel the time is right. Chamberlain is forced to choose the only man whom the opposition parties will accept: Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, who correctly predicted the danger from Adolf Hitler before the war.
Churchill tries to dismiss his new secretary Elizabeth Layton for mishearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine. King George VI, who strongly distrusts Churchill due to his support for his brother Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis, reluctantly invites him to form a government. Churchill includes Chamberlain (as Lord President of the Council) and Halifax (as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). That day, Germany invades Belgium and the Netherlands.
Churchill has a poor reputation in Parliament because of his record in the Admiralty, his role in the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, his views on India, Russian civil war and his past defection to the Liberal Party. Parliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising ""Blood, toil, tears, and sweat"". Chamberlain and Halifax are appalled by Churchill's refusal to negotiate for peace and plan to resign from the government to force a vote of no confidence, creating a situation in which Halifax would become the Prime Minister.
Churchill visits French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, who thinks Churchill delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France, while Churchill becomes furious that the French do not have a plan to counterattack. Although US President Franklin Roosevelt is sympathetic to Churchill's plight, his actions are limited by an isolationist Congress and the Neutrality Acts. Churchill draws ire from his cabinet and advisers for delivering a radio address in which he falsely implies the Allies to be advancing in France - as a refugee column is heavily bombed - earning him a rebuke from the King. Halifax and Chamberlain continue to push to use Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini as an intermediary with Germany.
The British Expeditionary Force is trapped at Dunkirk and Calais. Against the advice of the War Cabinet, Churchill orders Brigadier Nicholson in Calais to lead the 30th Infantry Brigade in a rearguard action to distract the enemy and buy time for the soldiers at Dunkirk to evacuate. Layton's brother is killed during the retreat.
The debacle in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. Under heavy pressure, Churchill agrees to consider a negotiated peace but cannot dictate a letter requesting talks. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King explains that he has come to like Churchill and encourages him to continue the war. Still uncertain, Churchill impulsively rides the London Underground (for the first time in his life) and asks startled passengers their opinion: the civilians all want to continue to fight. Churchill meets with the Outer Cabinet and other Members of Parliament and receives their support. The evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo, is successful.
As Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides first to listen to the address. Towards the end of his speech, Churchill proclaims that ""we shall fight on the beaches"" should the Germans invade, to resounding support from the Opposition. Chamberlain mops his brow with his handkerchief, a prearranged signal that the Tories should support the PM. Churchill exits the chamber to cheers and waving of order papers.

Mary Morrison (Kristen Davis), a successful author of thriller novels, is happily married to her husband Tom (Dermot Mulroney) with two young children. Her publisher asks her to write another book and offers her a two million dollar advance; she initially declines but is later forced to accept after Tom reveals he lost half of their estate by gambling on a risky investment. Mary's friend Elaine suggests she hires a nanny to help with the kids while she writes and, after a number of bad interviews, she employs Grace (Greer Grammer).
Mary suffers from writer's block and uses her blossoming friendship with Grace to inspire her. Mary then starts having what appears to be sexual fantasies about Grace. She also has what is seemingly a dream about Grace and Tom engaging in sexual activity in the kitchen, but cannot figure out whether it is a reality or a product of her vivid imagination. She confronts them both at the dinner table in a tearful rage, upsetting the children and causing a divide between her and Grace.
The following morning, Mary apologises to Grace, saying her outburst was the result of working too hard. Mary then calls the nanny agency to ask why they haven't cashed her check yet, and they tell her it's because she hasn't got back to them about choosing a nanny. Mary asks if they have a nanny called Grace under their service and they say they do not. Mary goes to see Elaine and finds her dead with a pair of scissors in her neck. After contacting the police, to her surprise and horror, Mary learns she is the main suspect in Elaine's murder as the police reveal there is multiple amounts of evidence that she was responsible, including a video of what appears to be Mary arriving at Elaine's house, although her face is obscured with a headscarf and sunglasses.
Mary then travels to Grace's hometown and visits her aunt, who reveals Grace had been abused by her parents as a child. Mary calls Tom to warn him about Grace but he does not answer. Back home, Tom is in the shower when Grace walks in dressed in lingerie and brandishing a large knife. She continuously switches from her usual sweet, soft-toned self to a violent seducer with a deep voice. As she attacks Tom, Mary arrives home. Grace claims to not know what happened to me, repeatedly saying, ""I couldn't stop her."" It is then revealed that Grace suffers from dissociative identity disorder and that her other identity ""Margaret"" is who attacked Tom. Mary eventually overpowers Grace, knocking her unconscious.
One year later, Mary and her family are still together. Mary takes the finished manuscript of her new book to Elaine's grave and leaves it there, as it was Elaine who encouraged her to start writing. She then goes to visit Grace in a mental hospital. The film ends with ""Mary"" leaving the hospital, her face obscured by a headscarf and sunglasses as in the police video.

","Netflix’s Deadly Illusions has been splashed across its homepage all week, daring me to invest in the story of a romance novelist who hires a nanny and “finds that the lines between fiction and reality have started to blur.” You know how it is when you hire a nanny and the lines between fiction and reality start to blur, right? You know!!! You know when you hire a nanny and then on like day two you get writer’s block and so you smoke a fat cigar and take your NANNY to the sexy underwear palace store TO BUY HER NEW BRAS??!?!If Netflix had wanted my attention on Deadly Illusions any earlier than when I got very sad around noon on Thursday, what they should’ve told me is that the lines between STRAIGHT and GAY will start to blur. Because my friends, they do. This is like, high camp, but also a gay movie for straight people? This is heterosexual camp. This is fan fiction but about two characters we’ve never heard of except one of them is Charlotte from Sex and the City.But I am getting ahead of myself! We begin like so: Mary (Kristin Davis) gets all dressed up to answer the door only to find herself saddled with a $2 million dollar offer from her millennial publishers to write another book in the series that made her famous. She hasn’t written in forever, though, because she has been focused on her two unmemorable children and their backpacks, a home with dynamic indoor/outdoor space and her ambiguously creepy husband Dermont Mulroney who secretly lost all their money in some situation I could not be bothered to retain.

Now Mary must hire a nanny. Sad! Luckily she finds the perfect nanny: Grace. How old is Grace? Nobody knows. Where does she live? This, too, does not come up. We do know however that she hails from the town of “River Springs” which Mary unfortunately has not heard of. What is Grace doing with her life? This does not matter! All that matters is that Grace dresses like a sexy American Girl doll / a grown woman throwing together a last-minute slutty Alice in Wonderland costume / the student who seduces a teacher in an inappropriate boarding school movie.Grace notices Mary’s books on the shelf. She turns to Mary, her face lit up like a Katy Perry firework and says, in absolute earnest: “I can’t believe I’m standing in the home of an actual writer!!!!” A lot of crazy-ass shit happens in this film but that was the moment when I should’ve known that things would eventually go as madly off the rails as they eventually did. Like, off the high-speed rails.Grace wears her hair in a single braid that screams PLAIT, topped off with a colorful bow. She wears different color bows every day to go with her outfits. She rides a vintage bicycle to and from work with a canvas tote on her shoulder and a goddamn bell like she is on her way to be Thora Birch’s body double in Now and Then. She does magic tricks! She packs a mean picnic basket! It is always autumn! She loves Judy Blume! She massages Mary’s feet. She massages Mary’s back. She maybe (?!?!!) massages Mary’s genitals with her mouth (?!?!) which is just to say that have any of you seen Losing Alice on Apple TV? This felt like that, except with a glossy American Netflix makeover and also, worse.Mary, meanwhile, likes to smoke cigars like someone who never smokes cigars while casting glances in Grace’s general direction and HANDWRITING AN ENTIRE NOVEL.

Also, Mary’s best friend is played by Shanola Hampton, aka Vee on Shameless, and I was personally offended that they did not hook up in the showers at the gym.I want to tell you more about Deadly Illusions. I want to tell you why I simultaneously insist you watch this straight gay film but also fail to recommend it. I want to tell you about a bathtub full of milk and variously colored rose petals and the complex mechanics of that specific fingerbang (I have questions!), and about someone getting scissored in the throat but I mean murdered not sex, and I guess some sort of multiple personality thing, and actually truly which parts were real?!!?!, and the complete unconcern from anybody involved in the production of this film that one single element of it make even the most remote amount of sense but I simply cannot. Have you ever tried to feed someone chili as FOREPLAY? Open your mouth, I have a ladle of honey for you and a secret past! You have to experience this absolute bananapants gay disaster for yourself. And then please come back here and tell me what was the male head at like 52:22?

Prior to producing Black Mirror, Brooker had done several end-of-year topical comedy specials for the BBC based on his Weekly Wipe series up through 2016. He had created a special Antiviral Wipe earlier in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brooker saw Death to 2020 as different to his previous topical comedy, as it is ""more character-based"" and he does not serve as presenter. He also described it as ""sillier"", summarising it as ""part record of the year, part spoof documentary and part character comedy"".It is produced by Broke and Bones, which Brooker and Annabel Jones founded after departing from House of Tomorrow, the production company they had worked with for the Endemol Shine group in producing Black Mirror. The two reportedly left House of Tomorrow over intellectual property rights issues. Netflix has a deal for exclusive rights over Broke and Bones productions. Death to 2020 is its first full production after the co-production Antiviral Wipe.The special was written with a team of writers over four months. It was filmed in late November across 10 days, in London and Los Angeles. Minimal crews were used due to the pandemic, with some actors in production bubbles. Each actor filmed for only one day. The Los Angeles filming shortly preceded a local lockdown there. Unlike Wipe specials, Brooker does not appear on-screen, but plays a director asking the talking heads questions. This decision was made partially because of an expectation that non-UK audiences would not be familiar with his appearance. Additionally, Diane Morgan appears in a different role—rather than recurring Wipe character Philomena Cunk, she plays Gemma Nerrick, ostensibly ""one of the five most average people in the world"". Cristin Milioti previously starred in Black Mirror episode ""USS Callister"".Actors influenced their characters' portrayal, with Brooker highlighting Kudrow in particular as having a number of things she felt strongly about. To appeal to a global audience, UK subjects such as the Dominic Cummings scandal were avoided. News of Biden's win and the Pfizer vaccine rollout arrived days before filming. Brooker and Jones were both involved with the editing process.Actor Hugh Grant revealed the project's existence in an interview with New York magazine in late November 2020, saying Brooker had written a mockumentary about the year 2020, which was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and described by some as a real-life version of a Black Mirror episode. Brooker said Grant would play the role of a historian who's being interviewed about the year. Further details of the special were announced in early December 2020, including many of the principal cast.

Critics branded the mockumentary as ""disappointing"", and compared it unfavourably to Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe and Black Mirror. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of 19 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.3/10. According to Metacritic, which calculated an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 11 critics, it received ""mixed or average reviews"".In a one star review for The Independent, Ed Cumming found that he was often ""waiting for punchlines that never arrive"", saying that Grant is ""not given a single decent line"". Cumming criticised the absence of Brooker's narration, as found in the Wipe series, and wrote that the work ""can't make up its mind whether it is for a British audience or an American one"".Chris Bennion gave the special two stars out of five in a review for The Telegraph, believing it to be a ""huge disappointment"" in which the humour is ""as predictable as the targets of the jokes"". Though reporting that most of the jokes are ""at best wearily familiar"", Bennion did find a few that ""carry Brooker's acidic wit and giddy surrealism"" and praised that Grant ""adroitly captures the pomposity of the Grand Old TV Don"". Another two star review came from Evening Standard's Nancy Durrant, who found it ""not as good"" as the Wipe specials. Durrant opined that a runtime of 45 minutes ""would have been quite enough"". Durrant praised Grant, Kudrow, Milioti and Morgan and the characters' names, along with some small jokes.Though praising some of the characters, including Jackson, Fishburne and Milioti, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B– in a negative review which summarised the mockumentary as ""obvious jokes over familiar footage"". Handlen found nothing ""particularly insightful"" and criticised ""a few lame stabs at 'both-sides-ing' the polarization of American politics"". The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg summarised the work as a ""generally hacky piece of recycled political satire and tired documentary parody"". Finding it ""astonishing how lazy everything is"", he viewed it as worse than many American topical comedies and said that the humour comes ""almost exclusively from the enthusiasm of an impressively star-studded cast"". However, Fienberg praised Milioti and Morgan and found it ""appropriate"" that Jackson discusses most of the George Floyd protest content with ""only anger and outrage"". The Los Angeles Times called the mockumentary a ""bitingly funny, hastily assembled and slightly deranged comedic retrospective"".

The concept of producing a documentary film about Maradona came after the director released the film Amy in 2015. Due to difficulty on finding a story with a beginning and an end, the director opted on Naples as being the centrepiece for the film. During the London Olympics in 2012, producer Paul Martin contacted the director after discovering archival footage but after the release of Senna the idea was pushed back. Martin and Gay-Rees met with someone outside of Naples who owned private material. The idea to document Maradona’s life began in 1981 by his first agent Jorge Cyterszpiler. This led to two Argentine cameramen recording hundreds of hours of film. However, the film never got produced. In Buenos Aires more archival footage was discovered in the home of Maradona’s ex-wife Claudia in a trunk untouched for 30 years.

Starring Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Jemaine Clement, Jeff Dunham, Bruce Greenwood and Ron Livingston, the film tells the story of a rising executive who finds out that his work superiors host a dinner celebrating the idiocy of their guests. He questions it when he is invited, just as he befriends a man who would be the perfect guest.
Dinner for Schmucks was released in theaters on July 30, 2010 by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures and grossed $86.9 million against a $69 million budget.","Section: Plot (1):
Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd) comes up with a way to get wealthy businessman Martin Mueller (David Walliams) as a client. Impressed by Tim's ingenuity, his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) says Tim is a candidate for a promotion but wants to get to know him better. He invites him to a dinner in which he must find and bring an eccentric person with a special talent to be mocked by the executives; the winner earns a trophy and the executive that brought him or her gets glory. Tim excitedly tells his long-time girlfriend, Julie (Stéphanie Szostak), about the possible promotion and dinner but she is offended by the idea of inviting strange people to a dinner just to mock them and tells him to refuse the invitation.
The next day Tim accidentally hits Barry Speck (Steve Carell) with his car when Barry tries to retrieve a dead mouse from the road. Witnessing Barry's bizarre behavior, including taxidermy and arranging mice into dioramas based on famous artwork, known as ""Mousterpieces"", Tim realizes he is the perfect idiot for the dinner. Julie finds out Tim is inviting Barry to the dinner and leaves their apartment after Tim insists on going, stating he has to in order to continue providing for them. Barry shows up at Tim's apartment thinking that the dinner event was that same evening, and accidentally invites over Darla (Lucy Punch), a girl Tim once had a one night stand with and who is obsessed with him. After Tim angrily scolds Barry for inviting Darla over and informs him who she is, Barry takes it upon himself to keep Darla away from Tim and accidentally ends up confronting Julie returning to the apartment. Their conversation leads her to believe Tim is cheating on her and she once again leaves. After Tim realizes what Barry has done he believes Julie may be at the home of Kieran Vollard (Jemaine Clement), an artist whose work she is selling at a gallery and who has expressed an interest in her.
Tim and Barry sneak into Vollard's apartment but learn that he is at his ranch. The two return home and Barry lets Darla into the house. Julie calls and asks Tim if he's having an affair and Darla steals the phone and stuffs it down her pants. The call ends abruptly, giving Julie the impression that Tim is, in fact, cheating on her. While Tim hides in his bedroom trying to reach Julie, Darla and Barry get into a bar-style fight, scaring Darla away.
Barry offers to take Tim to his job at the IRS to find Vollard's ranch address, where they meet up with Barry's boss and rival, Therman Murche (Zach Galifianakis) who claims to have the ""talent"" of mind control, and has authored a book about his talent. Therman is also revealed to have stolen Barry's ex-wife after Barry caught them cheating. Barry, Tim and Therman have a strange encounter at the IRS office, which only results in Tim getting audited. Tim leaves the next day for a brunch with the Mueller and his wife but Barry crashes it, bringing Darla along pretending to be Julie. Tim is pushed by Barry into asking Darla to marry him, and Julie walks in during the proposal. Tim and Barry chase Julie down to Vollard's ranch, where Tim finally snaps at Barry about his actions.
To his surprise, Tim finds Barry already at the dinner party, having forgiven Tim for his outburst. Barry's antics along with his ""Mousterpieces"" are a hit with the group, and he is seemingly a shoo-in for the trophy. Unexpectedly, however, Therman arrives as the ""guest"" of another executive, embarrassing Barry with his mind control. Tim then tells Barry everything and, after some encouragement, gets Barry to defeat Therman by using his own powers of ""brain control"". Fender congratulates Tim on bringing Barry to the dinner as his idiot, and Tim, offended, insults Fender before defending Barry. The other guests then learn they were brought to the dinner only to be mocked, leading to a chaotic brawl between the guests and the executives. The brawl ultimately leads to Mueller losing his finger and prized family ring and Fender's mansion burning down.
After returning to Tim's apartment, Tim and Julie manage to reconcile with Barry's help. Tim is fired as is Julie after Barry makes Vollard realize it would be a problem to have her continue working for him. Tim and Julie marry, Barry gets to have sex with Darla and also does some artwork with Vollard while Therman writes a book in a mental hospital.

The production budget was $69 million, but with tax credits the cost came in at $62.7 million. Filming of the dinner scene took place at the same location as was used for Wayne Manor in the 1960s Batman television series.Dinner for Schmucks is the American adaptation of the French film Le Dîner de Cons (literally, ""The Dinner of Idiots""). The film retains many familiar elements of the original, with the basic plot, including the involvement of the taxation authorities and the love triangle around the main character Tim. In the remake, however, Tim is made much more sympathetic (this is the first dinner he has participated in, and he is not in fact having an affair or deliberately cheating on his taxes), and the actual dinner is shown. Director Roach describes the film as ""inspired by"" the original rather than a remake.

Debate ensued about the title's usage of the Yiddish word schmucks which is a mild cultural insult similar to ""idiot"" which technically refers to 'male genitals'.
Debbie Schlussel asked whether the title should have been Dinner for Schlemiels as it would better describe the clumsy character played by Steve Carell.
Responding in The New York Times, critic Michael Cieply determined that the intent was to be ambiguous as to which of the two main characters, played by Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, was the intended idiot.In The Forward, Laura Hodes suggested that 'schmucks' correctly referred instead to the behavior of the film's antagonists, the bosses of Rudd's character.

33,Don't Listen,Spain,Estudio v,Netflix,,,98,,,443458,,,,,"They’ve sunk everything they have into their latest “fixer upper.” It’s a big, remote manor house in Spain, and it’s their biggest project, if not their first.

But their angel-faced son Eric (Lucas Blas) is spooked. His toys are switching on by themselves. And he’s hearing things, “voices” in his head, in radios, in the walkie talkie he uses to keep in touch with Dad (Rodolfo Sancho) and Mom (Ana Fernández).

And that shrink (Beatriz Arjona) they’ve called in? She’s not getting answers to her “What do the voices want?” queries.

“I’m not allowed to tell you,” Eric mumbles (in Spanish with English subtitles.

But the static-filled whispers go on, Eric draws pictures of what he hears and the flies — the FLIES! They’re always buzzing around.

When one flies into the psychotherapist’s ear on her static-filled drive home, that’s all she wrote. And she’s just the first grisly fatality in “Voces,” retitled “Don’t Listen” for North American Netflix.

This latest H-Horror (Hispanic Horror) film is a real kitchen-sink ghost story. As in the script throws in everything but the kitchen sink.

Flies, scratchy voices, apparitions, a father and daughter team of scientists investigating that big, old house and…wait for it — The Spanish Inquisition even figures in.

Because to this day “Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!”

It’s an ungainly affair, not at all a graceful film. We lurch from the kid hearing the voices to a shocking death or two, a brief mention of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) when the parents see this writer and expert on the subject (Ramón Barea) interviewed on TV and before you know it, he’s been dragged out there, with his sonic engineer daughter (Belén Fabra) for a little infrared camera/microphones all around investigating.

Because Dani (Sancho) is hearing dead people. Does that mean they’re not really dead?

“You’re clinging to something that can’t come back.”

I tend to like haunted house tales built around “investigations” — the “experts” shocked and awed by encountering the reality of the supernatural, often for the first time. But “Don’t Listen” left me cold. And the deeper we get into “explanations” that are more just revelations about the house’s past, the duller it gets.

A surprise twist or two is nice. But the many people with a hand in feeding ideas to screenwriter Santiago Díaz and director Ángel Gómez Hernández missed the obvious and break a couple of cardinal rules of horror.

They set up stakes, and then remove them by killing off somebody we’re supposed to care about in the first act. And then they expect us to shift alliances and root for the investigators, who aren’t remotely as engaging as say the daffy ghost hunters of the “Insidious” movies.

It’s nicely shot and cut together, but the disconnect from the characters makes “Don’t Listen” too easy to tune out. ",6.1,9757," Drama, Horror, Mystery",Negative,0.89

",,"In Double Dad (Pai Em Dobro), now streaming on Netflix, an 18-year-old girl dreams of discovering the identity of her father. The film is yet another on the ever-increasing list of Portuguese-language films on the streamer, and this time around, it’s acceptable fare for the whole family. Is this quirky Brazilian adventure worth the time? We’re here to find out. The Gist: Every year on her birthday, Vicenza (Maisa Silva) wishes for the same thing: to know who her father is. Vicenza’s eighteenth birthday is no exception, but her mother Raion (Laila Zaid) still refuses to give her any information. They seem happy with their lives in a hippie commune somewhere beautiful in Brazil, but it’s clear Vicenza yearns for something more. When her mother takes a trip to India, Vicenza seizes the opportunity to find out the truth about her father. With only a photo from a past Carnival to guide her, she sets off for Santa Teresa in the hopes of connecting with her potential father. She’s delighted to find that Paco (Eduardo Moscavis) is an artist like herself, but she is not as warmly received by him. It takes him some time to accept the possible reality of the situation, but he comes around, and they begin to bond as she experiences the outside world for the first time and he takes a shot at fatherhood.

Just when things seem perfect, however, Vicenza discovers a second photo – one of her mother with another man during the same time period. Now unsure of her father’s identity, she goes to pay him a visit too. Giovanne (Marcelo Médici) is seemingly the opposite of Paco; he’s a financial advisor who seems to have it all together, and he takes the news better than one might expect. Vicenza connects with both men in the way she’d always hoped she might with her father, only further complicating the situation. With two potential fathers, a mother abroad, and a new group of artsy friends around, Vicenza gets more than she ever bargained for.What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Double Dad feels like Mamma Mia! meets Eat, Pray, Love, a fish-out-of-water story with a wholesome hunt for truth.

Performance Worth Watching: The ensemble here is very solid, but as Giovanne, Marcelo Médici is just utterly endearing. His nervous energy and immediate affection for Vicenza is enough to make your heart melt, and he subverts expectations with his businessman with a heart of gold persona.

Memorable Dialogue: It might seem on the nose, but I was charmed by the words of Mother Moon after Vicenza struggles to complete her self portrait: “You have to know yourself better before making a self portrait”. It really sets things up for the journey to come. 

Sex and Skin: While there are some references to Vicenza’s mom’s flings, there’s nothing explicit here. Family friendly fare.

Our Take: There’s a sweetness to Double Dad that caught me off guard; maybe it’s because I’m so used to watching more cynical stories play out, or maybe it’s because I myself have become a bit of a cynic, but I was not expecting to get as warm and fuzzy as Double Dad made me feel. It’s a simple enough tale, one we’ve seen play out before in favorites like Mamma Mia!, but it feels like a story all its own, one with a big heart and open arms for all who wish to embrace it. The key to the film is Maisa Silva, a dazzling young performer who has exactly the Netflix teen star energy one expects from flicks of this nature. She plays the wide-eyed hippie-girl-meets-city-life part without it ever coming off too campy or try-hard, and her earnestness is totally believable. Double Dad doesn’t work without Vicenza, and Silva perfectly fits the bill, pushing us to cheer for her victories and ache for her failures. The entire ensemble follows suit, coming together to create a crew endearing, funny, and, despite the silliness of a lot of the writing, wholly authentic.

Double Dad juggles multiple storylines with ease, including Vicenza’s budding love story, Raion’s goofy trip to India, and the respective dads’ own lives and the way this all affects them. The messaging here – about forging one’s own identity and choosing your family – is wholesome and important, even if it is coated in some saccharine storytelling. It’s nice to see these kinds of themes in a film targeted towards tweens and younger teens, and I really appreciated that the love story was treated as one of the less important ones. This is really Vicenza’s story and about how she chooses to identify herself and who she chooses to surround herself with, and that’s what makes the film so resonant.

A reboot of the Dracula film series, the plot creates an origin story for the titular character, rather than using the storyline of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. In this adaptation, Dracula is the monster alter ego of historical figure Vlad III ""the Impaler"" Drăculea. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance cast in supporting roles. Principal photography began in Northern Ireland on August 5, 2013.
Universal Pictures released the film in regular and IMAX cinemas on October 10, 2014. Dracula Untold grossed $217 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.","Section: Plot (1):
In 15th-century, Vlad Drăculea is the Prince of Wallachia and Transylvania. As a child, he was a royal ward in the palace of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite Janissaries corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called ""Vlad the Impaler, Son of the Dragon"", after slaughtering thousands by impaling them on spears, but became sickened by his own acts and abandoned his past.
Now ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's retinue. Returning to his castle, Vlad learns from a local monk that the creature is a vampire, a Roman from the days of the Empire named Caligula, who was tricked by a demon for personal success and great powers, but was trapped in the cave as price for this. Vlad celebrates an Easter feast with his wife Mirena and son Îngeraș, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the emissary wants an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries. Vlad refuses. Mirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan Mehmed II to show mercy. Vlad offers himself in place of the boys; but Mehmed refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition.
Knowing war is coming, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken by having given the darkness a worthy offering to plague the world like himself. Vlad accepts the offer. He discovers that he has the ability to transform into a cloud of bats. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad single-handedly kills them all. He then sends most of the castle's subjects to Cozia Monastery for safety.
Mirena learns of Vlad's curse, as she sees him holding silver to keep himself weak when near his people to avoid revealing his condition to them or attacking them for blood. Vlad's sudden increased strength also arouses suspicion among his subjects.
That night, the Ottoman army marches on the monastery. Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap Îngeraș. Mirena tries to defend her son, and falls from the edge of the monastery wall. Despite his superhuman speed, Vlad cannot reach her in time. Dying, Mirena pleads with Vlad to drink her blood before the sun rises and lifts his curse, so that he will have the strength to save their son. Vlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers, and in doing so he frees the ancient vampire from his cave by breaking the magical seal imprisoning him. As he does so, he summons black storm clouds to block out the sun. Vlad returns to the monastery and turns the small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well.
At the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe. Vlad and his vampires arrive, hidden by a large lightning storm, and easily massacre the terrified Ottoman soldiers, while Vlad himself goes after Mehmed, who is holding Îngeraș captive. Aware that vampires are weakened by silver, Mehmed has lined the floor of his tent with silver coins, making Vlad's strength and speed that of a human — and impairing his vision — as Mehmed fights him with a silver sword. He overpowers Vlad and prepares to impale his heart with a wooden stake, but Vlad turns into a flock of bats and evades him. Taking the name ""Dracula, Son of the Devil"", he kills Mehmed with the stake and drinks his blood. Vlad then sends Îngeraș away before his vampire army preys on him, and dispels the storm clouds so that the vampires, including himself, will burn away and die in the light. However, a man who had previously observed Vlad's nature and wished to serve him drags his dying body out of the sunlight and offers him his blood, which restores Vlad to life. With Vlad presumed dead and Europe saved from the Ottoman invasion, Îngeraș is crowned the new Prince of Wallachia.
In the present day, Vlad now known as Dracula meets a woman named Mina who strikingly resembles Mirena, in the streets of a modern city (London). The vampire who cursed Vlad watches them from afar. As they walk away, he follows, saying ""Let the games begin"".

The site's critical consensus reads, ""Neither awful enough to suck nor sharp enough to bite, Dracula Untold misses the point of its iconic character's deathless appeal."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A-"" on an A+ to F scale.Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Much like the recent, widely reviled I, Frankenstein, this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board."" The Village Voice's Alan Scherstuhl criticized the film, ""And so it was, and so it was dull, the greatest villain in all cinema bitten on the neck and drained of his hottest blood."" Simon Adams for Roger Ebert's website gave Dracula Untold a score of 2.5/4 along with an average review, ""If you can selectively ignore this litany of inanity, you may find some substantial earthy pleasures in Dracula Untold."" Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade and wrote, ""It works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid."" Stephen Whitty wrote a negative review for The Star-Ledger, ""If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself—and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes—then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?"" The Seattle Times' Moira MacDonald said, ""It falls into that far-too-large category of studio offerings that aren't good enough to be noteworthy or terrible enough to be truly entertaining.""A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club said, ""Neither the Dracula we need nor the one we deserve."" New York magazine's Bilge Ebiri wrote, ""I don't want to oversell this film. But in an era in which we've seen a lot of failed attempts to reinvent classic fantasy tales as CGI-action spectacles, it feels remarkably assured."" Film critic Mick LaSalle gave the film two stars out of four and wrote for San Francisco Chronicle, ""Here we have a vampire movie that brings together elements from other more popular movies."" Daniel Krupa from IGN said, ""Dracula Untold recasts the famous vampire as a dark superhero. It's fast-paced, shallow fun."" Tim Robey of The Telegraph positively said, ""This origin story, starring Luke Evans, really isn't as bad as it might have been."" He later added, ""The intrigue can feel a little mechanical, but it doesn't overstay its welcome as badly as the clomping, similarly-designed Snow White and the Huntsman."" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post reviewed and responded in negative, ""The film's problems aren't limited to liberal cadging from comic books. In fact, that's precisely what's best about the film, which occasionally boasts gorgeous visuals. But the movie doesn't know when to stop stealing."" Jordan Hoffman of New York Daily News said, ""The weapons, Turkish helmets and Szekler interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this Lord of the Rings wanna-be were at the same level."" Kevin C. Johnson commented for St. Louis Post-Dispatch ""Dracula Untold feels longer than its 95-minute running time.""New York Post's Kyle Smith wrote, ""This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle."" Brian Truitt of USA Today said, ""At times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stoker's legacy."" Toronto Star's Peter Howell asked, ""Whatever possessed the makers of Dracula Untold to think we'd be interested in a tragically unhip romance that backstories the infamous bloodsucker?"" The Boston Globe's Peter Keough criticized the film, ""It's not so much untold as rewritten—if not by J. R. R. Tolkien than by some clever 12-year-old overstimulated by The Lord of the Rings."" Film critic Ben Kenigsberg reviewed the film for The New York Times, ""The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee."" James Berardinelli reviewed for website ReelViews, ""A generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re-interpretation of a legendary monster."" The Philadelphia Inquirer's David Hiltbrand said, ""The idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the Western crypt. But Dracula Untold goes way overboard, past domestication and into canonization."" Wesley Morris wrote for the website Grantland, ""Most of the time, I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls.""Richard Corliss from Time magazine compared Dracula's origin story to Jesus Christ's story due to Dracula spending his childhood in a foreign land, and due to Dracula choosing to die (or become undead) in order to save his people. Corliss also complimented the film's use of its PG-13 rating by describing it as ""robust"". In his review, he stated, ""Most reviewers have slammed the movie, but it's not nearly as awful, or offal, as its critical odor."" He later stated, ""[Evans] carries Untold by admirably fulfilling the two essential functions of a period-movie hero: to enunciate comic-book dialogue with Shakespearean authority and to look great with his shirt off."" Graham Killeen of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel gave a positive review and wrote, ""Dracula Untold tries to be The Lord of the Rings of horror movies. Surprisingly, it mostly succeeds."" Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant gave a fairly moderate review stating, ""Dracula Untold is not a masterful or deep re-introduction to the franchise; but as basic genre fare, it's relatively fun in its depiction of the monster in a different light."" Los Angeles Times critic Gary Goldstein wrote a positive review saying, ""As effective and fat-free as its sinewy star, Luke Evans, Dracula Untold proves an absorbing, swiftly comprehensive origin tale.""The film has been accused of Islamophobia for portraying Vlad the Impaler as a hero and for the vilification of Mehmed II even though, according to Turkish journalist Elest Ali Korkmaz, ""it was Vlad who indiscriminately killed Turkish and Bulgarian civilians"".

Starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, it tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two dumb but well-meaning friends from Providence, Rhode Island, who set out on a cross-country trip to Aspen, Colorado, to return a briefcase full of money to its owner, thinking it was abandoned as a mistake though it was actually left as ransom money. Lauren Holly, Karen Duffy, Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, and Teri Garr play supporting roles.
The film was released on December 16, 1994. It grossed $247 million at the box office and has developed a cult following in the years after its release. The success of Dumb and Dumber launched the career of the Farrelly brothers and solidified Carrey's reputation as one of the most prominent actors of the 1990s. The film also spawned an animated TV series, a 2003 prequel, and a 2014 sequel.","Section: Plot (1):
Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, two kind but dimwitted men, are best friends and roommates living in Providence, Rhode Island. Lloyd, a chip-toothed limousine driver, immediately falls in love when he meets Mary Swanson, a woman he is driving to the airport. She leaves a briefcase in the terminal. Lloyd retrieves the case and hopes to return it to her, unaware that it contains ransom money for her kidnapped husband, Bobby, and that she was supposed to leave it for her husband's captors, Joe ""Mental"" Mentalino and J. P. Shay. Her Aspen-bound plane has already departed, leading to Lloyd running through and falling out of the jetway.
Fired from his job, Lloyd returns to his apartment and learns that Harry has also been fired from his dog-grooming job after delivering dogs late to a show and accidentally getting them dirty. Mental and Shay follow Lloyd home from the airport in pursuit of the briefcase. Mistaking the crooks for debt collectors, the duo flee the apartment and return later to find that Mental and Shay have ransacked the apartment and decapitated Harry's parakeet. Lloyd suggests they head to Aspen to find Mary and return the briefcase, hoping she can ""plug them into the social pipeline"". At first, Harry opposes the idea, but he eventually agrees and the duo leaves the next day.
Mental and Shay catch up to the duo at a motel that night. Posing as a hitchhiker, Mental is picked up by Harry and Lloyd while Shay secretly follows them. During a lunch stop, the duo prank Mental with chili peppers in his burger, unaware that he has an ulcer. When Mental reacts adversely, they accidentally kill him with rat poison pills (which he planned to use on them) after mistaking it for his medication. Nearing Colorado, Lloyd takes a wrong turn while trying to stop Harry's snoring by plugging his nose at the fork between Aspen and Nebraska and ends up driving all night through Nebraska. Meanwhile, the police are waiting on the road to Colorado for them to show up, after finding out about Mental's death. Upon waking up and realizing Lloyd's mishap, Harry gives up on the journey and decides to walk home, but Lloyd later persuades him to continue after trading the van for a minibike.
The two arrive in Aspen, but are unable to locate Mary. After a short scuffle over some gloves that night, the briefcase breaks open and they discover the money; they spend it on a hotel suite, clothes, and a car. They learn that Mary and her family are hosting a gala and prepare to attend. At the gala, Harry, attempting to lure Mary over to Lloyd, reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day and lies to Lloyd that he got him a date. The next day, Lloyd finds out Harry lied to him after waiting all day for Mary at the hotel bar.
In retaliation, Lloyd pranks Harry by serving him a coffee laced with a potent dose of laxative, causing Harry to spontaneously defecate in a broken toilet at Mary's house. Lloyd arrives at Mary's house and informs her that he has her briefcase. He takes her to the hotel, shows her the briefcase, and confesses his love after some initial struggle; she rejects him, as she is already married. Nicholas Andre, an old friend of the Swansons and the mastermind behind Bobby's kidnapping, arrives with Shay and, upon learning that Harry and Lloyd had spent all of the ransom money and replaced it with IOUs, takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, as well as Harry when he returns. An argument leads Nicholas to shoot Harry. Before Nicholas can kill them, an FBI team led by Beth Jordan (whom Harry met earlier at a gas station and Lloyd met earlier at the bar) raids the suite and arrests him and Shay. Harry is revealed to be alive thanks to a bulletproof vest that was strapped on him earlier. Mary and Bobby are reunited.
The next day, Harry and Lloyd are seen walking home on foot because all their purchases were confiscated and their minibike has broken down. The two unintentionally decline the chance to be oil boys for a group of bikini girls, after which Harry tells Lloyd that they will get their ""break"" one day. Harry and Lloyd then play a friendly game of tag as they walk back to Rhode Island.

The Farrelly Brothers had been trying for years to get their first movie made. Director Peter Farrelly's agent encouraged him to make a movie himself, alongside his brother Bobby.
The Farrelly Brothers didn't know who Jim Carrey was; they were only told that he was ""The White Guy"" on In Living Color. Only after a screening of Carrey's first major acting role, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, did they realize they had struck gold. Based on the box-office success of Ace Ventura, Carrey was able to negotiate a salary of $7 million for this film.Nicolas Cage, who was proposed to be Carrey's co-star, tried to negotiate a $2 million increase in his fee but New Line decided against casting him and signed Jeff Daniels instead. Daniels was only paid around $50,000. New Line Cinema originally did not want Daniels in the film, as he was known only for his dramatic work at the time. However, the Farrellys and Carrey wanted Daniels for the part. Although New Line agreed to their demands, Daniels was offered the low salary in the hopes it would discourage him from signing on to the film. Daniels ultimately accepted the role, despite his agent reportedly dissuading him out of fears it would kill his career.Steve Martin and Martin Short both turned down the role of Lloyd.  According to Splitsider, Gary Oldman and Cage were the original choices for Lloyd and Harry.  Chris Elliott and Rob Lowe were both also considered for the role of Harry.Carrey's chipped tooth is genuine, resulting from a fight with a classmate in his childhood, but he had since had it capped. He simply had the crown temporarily removed from that tooth to portray Lloyd.

Development of the film began in August 2017, then under the title The Maze, and the casting process commenced. Filming took place in South Africa in late 2017 through January 2018.
Escape Room was released in the United States on January 4, 2019, by Sony Pictures Entertainment, and grossed over $155 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere and cast, but criticized the familiar plot and its failure to take full advantage of its premise. A sequel, Escape Room 2, is planned for release in 2022.","Section: Plot (1):
Six people from varied backgrounds are presented with a puzzle cube: Zoey, a physics student; Jason, a wealthy daytrader; Ben, a stockboy; Mike, a truck driver; Amanda, an Iraq War veteran; and Danny, an escape room enthusiast. When they solve the puzzle, they are invited to take part in an escape room with a $10,000 prize. The participants arrive at an office block and gather in a waiting room waiting, but no one comes to greet them.
When Ben tries to leave, the door handle falls off, revealing that the challenge has begun. The room turns out to be a giant oven that begins to heat up. The players discover an escape passage and climb out before the room is filled with fire. Next, they find themselves in a winter cabin. They escape the cabin and step out into an icy room where the temperature is dropping. They eventually find the key, but Danny falls through the ice and drowns, confirming that they are dealing with potentially fatal rooms rather than just an elaborate game. Some players notice reminders of traumatic events in their past: A song Ben heard before almost dying in a car crash and a red coat Jason wore when he escaped a shipwreck. The remaining five players enter an upside-down billiards bar, where parts of the floor periodically fall into a deep shaft below. In helping the others escape, Amanda plummets to her death.
The next room is a hospital ward with six beds, each representing a player. It is revealed that all six players were each sole survivors of various disasters: Mike escaped a mine cave-in, Zoey survived a plane crash, Danny survived when his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Amanda survived an IED blast, Jason survived a shipwreck in frigid weather, and Ben survived a car accident where his friends died. Zoey realizes that the purpose of the game is to determine which player is the luckiest of all. Jason discovers that the room is about to be filled with poisonous gas. Zoey refuses to continue playing and instead destroys the room's surveillance cameras. A clip about a heart surgeon called ""Dr. Wootan Yu"" suggests that someone needs to record a certain heart rate to escape. Mike has the highest heart rate, but not high enough to work. Jason suggests using the defibrillator on Mike. Mike is unwilling at first, but Jason manipulates him to participate. Jason accidentally kills Mike with a shock. He then solves the puzzle as the gas is released. Jason and Ben escape, but Zoey refuses to follow and disappears into the gas.
Jason and Ben enter a room with optical illusions and strobe lights. While drugged with a hallucinogen, they fight over an antidote. Ben kills Jason and injects himself with the antidote. He then falls into the last room, where a wall moves inwards to crush him. In the hospital room, employees enter in hazmat gear to dispose of the dead bodies. Zoey appears and attacks them. Ben solves the last room and meets the Gamemaster, who controls the game that the Puzzle Maker designed. The Gamemaster explains that each year they lure in players with something in common – college athletes, savants, etc. – and wealthy viewers bet on the result, with the current game luring in sole survivors of previous disasters. The Gamemaster tries to kill Ben, but Zoey intervenes, and together they kill the Gamemaster.
As Ben recovers, Zoey returns to the building with a detective. The police do not believe Zoey, as all evidence of the game has disappeared. They do not believe Ben either, as he was found to have drugs in his system. While looking at the graffiti on the wall, Zoey notices the words ""No Way Out"", an anagram for ""Wootan Yu"", suggesting the game is not over. Six months later, Zoey meets up with Ben and shows him newspaper articles that passed off the other players' deaths as everyday accidents. When Ben suggests Zoey should move on, she refuses. She reveals clues to Ben that point to an unlisted building in Manhattan. Ben agrees to go with her. However, the Puzzle Maker is already preparing to make their flight a new deadly game of survival.

The film focuses on a 35-year-old man living with his parents who shows no interest in leaving the comfortable life that they, especially his mother, have made for him. It was released on March 10, 2006, and grossed over $128 million.","Section: Plot (1):
35-year-old Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) still lives with his parents Al (Terry Bradshaw) and Sue (Kathy Bates) in Baltimore. His best friends Demo (Bradley Cooper) and Ace (Justin Bartha) also still live in their parents' homes and seem proud of it. Tripp has had a number of casual girlfriends. When he tires of them, he invites them to “his place""—and when they realize he still lives at home, they promptly dump him.
Al and Sue are fascinated when their friends, whose adult son recently left home, reveal they hired an expert to induce him to move out. The expert is Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker), who believes that men continue to live at home because they have low self-esteem. Her approach is to establish a relationship with the man to build his confidence, then transfer his attachment from his parents to her. However, she finds that Tripp does not fit her previous profiles, as he has normal social skills, good self-esteem, and a good job he enjoys. After an awkward encounter with his parents, Paula thwarts Tripp's attempt to dump her and has sex with him, all the while developing real feelings for him. She and Tripp find themselves in unfamiliar waters and confide in their friends.
Paula's vocation exasperates her roommate Kit (Zooey Deschanel), who thinks Paula took the job because a man broke her heart who lived with his parents. Paula is shocked when she learns why Tripp lives at home: His life collapsed when his fiancée suddenly died, and his family has been his solace since then.
Ace discovers what is going on and blackmails Paula for a date with Kit; although Kit is more attracted to Demo, she and Ace wind up falling in love. Ace then ""outs""  Paula to Demo, who then reveals all to Tripp. Tripp angrily confronts his parents and breaks up with Paula. Wracked with guilt, Paula refunds Al's and Sue's money. After an awkward confrontation, Tripp forgives his parents, but he can't forgive Paula for manipulating him.
Tripp's parents and friends devise a plan to reconcile the two. They tie up and gag Tripp and lock him and Paula together in a room. Paula pours her heart out to him, and he finally forgives her. The film ends with Al and Sue in their empty nest, happily singing ""Hit the Road, Tripp"". This fades into the closing credits over the Ray Charles song ""Hit the Road, Jack"", and we see Tripp and Paula sail away on his newly purchased boat.

An untitled third film is scheduled for release in summer 2022.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1927, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) transfers the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald to Europe to stand trial, but Grindelwald escapes. Three months later in London, Newt Scamander visits the Ministry of Magic to appeal his international travel ban, and runs into Leta Lestrange, his Hogwarts classmate and the fiancée of his Auror brother Theseus. The Ministry agree to grant Newt's request if he helps Theseus locate Credence Barebone in Paris, but Newt declines after learning he must work with ruthless bounty hunter Gunnar Grimmson. Albus Dumbledore asks Newt to save Credence from Grindelwald and the Ministry, believing Credence is Leta's long-lost half-brother, Corvus Lestrange V.
Newt is visited by his American friends Queenie Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, a Muggle, who has regained his memories erased the previous year. Newt is disappointed to learn Queenie's sister Tina Goldstein is seeing someone after mistakenly believing Newt and Leta were engaged. He deduces from Jacob's strange behaviour that Queenie enchanted him into eloping to circumvent MACUSA's ban on marriage between wizards and non-magical people. After Newt lifts the enchantment, Jacob refuses to marry Queenie, fearing the consequences she would face. Queenie leaves to find Tina, who is looking for Credence in Paris, followed by Newt and Jacob.
In Paris, Credence escapes the Circus Arcanus with captive performer Nagini. Searching for Credence's birth mother, they locate half-elf servant Irma Dugard, who brought him to America for adoption. Grimmson, revealed to be a follower of Grindelwald, kills Irma. Tina meets Yusuf Kama, who is also hunting Credence. Newt and Jacob follow Yusuf to Tina, only to find her being held hostage. Yusuf imprisons them as well, explaining he made an Unbreakable Vow to kill his half-brother, whom he believes to be Credence. Unable to find Tina, a distraught Queenie is brought to Grindelwald; knowing Queenie's abilities, he allows her to leave while manipulating her into joining him through her desire to marry Jacob.
Newt and Tina infiltrate the French Ministry of Magic for documents to confirm Credence's identity, but are discovered by Leta and Theseus; Tina and Newt reconcile after he explains he was never engaged to Leta. Their search leads them to the Lestrange family tomb, where they find Yusuf, who reveals that he is carrying out his father Mustafa's request to avenge his mother Laurena: she was kidnapped by Corvus Lestrange IV using the Imperius Curse, and died giving birth to Leta, Yusuf's half-sister. Leta reveals that she unintentionally caused Corvus V’s death: sailing to America, Leta, unable to stand his constant crying, switched her baby brother with another infant, Credence; the ship sank, and Corvus drowned.
The group follow a trail to a rally for Grindelwald's followers, where Queenie is among the attendees and Jacob is looking for her. Grindelwald shows a vision of a future global war, and rails against the laws prohibiting them from preventing such a tragedy. As Theseus and the Aurors surround the rally, Grindelwald prompts his followers to spread his message across Europe, and conjures a ring of blue fire that kills the retreating Aurors and that only his most loyal followers can safely cross. Queenie and Credence cross the fire, while Leta sacrifices herself so the others can escape. As Grindelwald and his followers depart, the remaining wizards and immortal alchemist Nicolas Flamel extinguish the fire. Newt chooses to join the fight against Grindelwald.
At Hogwarts, Newt presents Dumbledore with a vial stolen from Grindelwald, containing a blood pact Grindelwald and Dumbledore made in their youth that prevents them dueling each other; Dumbledore believes it can be destroyed. At Nurmengard Castle, his Austrian base, Grindelwald presents Credence with a wand, informs Credence that a phoenix appears to any Dumbledore in need of it and reveals Credence’s true identity: Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus and Aberforth's long-lost brother. Credence then demonstrates his newfound power as a wizard by using his new wand to blast apart a mountainside.

I felt bad that she had to take that.""Jude Law was cast as Albus Dumbledore after director David Yates decided that the character should be played by a younger actor, not Michael Gambon (who played the role in six of the Harry Potter films).

Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising the performances of Law and Depp but criticising the film's excessive plotting, writing, ""This Fantastic Beasts film is as watchable and entertaining as expected... but some of the wonder, novelty and sheer narrative rush of the first film has been mislaid in favour of a more diffuse plot focus, spread out among a bigger ensemble cast."" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 5, and criticized the film for being overlong and exposition heavy, saying it feels ""like an overload of homework"" and suggested it was too much for Muggles and best left to fans only. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote: ""It offers up dazzling feats of sorcery and realms of wonderment [...] and manages to conjure the very opposite of magic."" Chang found Newt to be ""charmless"" and the plot ""grindingly complicated,"" though he welcomed the introduction of Jude Law as Dumbledore.

41,Fierce,Poland,ATM Grupa S.A.,,,,128,,,389978,,,,,"Fierce (Netflix) concerns a Polish teen’s attempt to confront her absentee rock star father through an unlikely prism: becoming a contestant on the competitive singing show on which he’s a judge so she can face him down and win it, just for spite. Fierce has its moments, but there might be more grist for drama on an actual, real world singing program.The Gist: Music Race is the biggest thing going on Polish television. The Idol-style competitive reality show features as poobah of its judges’ table Olo (Maciej Zakoscielny), a smarmy rocker who’s still coasting on his radio hits from two decades ago. He’s jaded and bored, and gets his kicks from unleashing a reverse dunk tank of water on the heads of competitors he deems unfit for the show’s next round. Olo’s livid when Music Race‘s producer orchestrates a round of auditions to be held in Rozalin, the hometown he left behind, because a quiet, provincial life isn’t the only thing he walked out on when fame came calling. Marta Ostowiscz, 18, lives with her mother and grandmother in Rozalin, and she sees the local auditions as a chance to give her deadbeat dad what for. In fully-flanneled Grunge Teen chic, she sneaks into the audition, cuts in line, and gets to the mic. “Jerk! Pig! Clown!” she rants at Olo. “You’re the washout!” And she throws a glass of water in his face. “Are you getting this?” The producer gleefully asks his control room. Because he’s just uncovered ratings gold.

As it turns out, Marta, or “Ostra,” can really sing. (Fierce features Katarzyna Sawczuk as Marta, who first made her bones on IRL singing competitions like Mam Talent! and The Voice of Poland before transitioning into acting.) And while her wise hippie grandmother encourages her to compete on Music Race because she’s talented, Marta has a different take. “I’ll stay and win, just to spite him!” She does win, and viewers are smitten. Marta’s an overnight sensation and blowing up all over social media, even as Olo feels his celebrity slipping into oblivion.

As the trappings of sudden fame begin to overtake Marta’s sensibilities, Olo can’t decide if he wants to sabotage her winning streak or try to reconcile with her and her mother. Music Race‘s producer, meanwhile, has one last ratings gambit up his sleeve. “Singing — he seems to spit the word out — “is not gonna get us ratings!” says the boss of a show about competitive singing. He knows what the people really want.

What Movies Will It Remind You Of? In The Idol (Palestine, 2016; streaming on Vudu), a teen with all the talent in the world travels to Egypt to compete on Arab Idol. Like Fierce, Teen Spirit (2018; Hulu) similarly observes the landscape between the humdrum life and stardom, and features a great Elle Fanning performance as the everyday teenager taking her shot on a competitive singing show. For song singin’ alongside bright, bawdy ensemble cast laughs, the first Pitch Perfect (2012; Vudu) never fails to deliver.

Performance Worth Watching: Maria Pakulnis, as Marta’s supportive, cheeky Grandmother, observes the goings-on with Olo and Music Race with a wink in her eye and a drink in her hand. She drives a VW microbus with curtains in the back; there’s a well-thumbed stack of records next to her turntable. When Olo comes by the house in Rozalin to grovel for forgiveness, she has one comment: “You look old.”

Memorable Dialogue: Ewa (Julia Kaminska) is another judge on Music Race, and Olo’s squeeze. Her pop star days are gone, and a catty social media presence is all she has left. But as Marta’s star rapidly rises, Ewa sees her chance at staying in the limelight slipping away. “She is the talk of the town and only getting good press!” She rages to Olo, exasperated at Marta’s fawning media attention. “She hasn’t even come up with a one hashtag!”

Sex and Skin: Marta’s official arrival as a trending topic is accompanied by a hilarioulsy over-the-top tabloid photo shoot replete with latex S&M gear.

Our Call: Competitive reality programs and their ability to transform nobodies into somebodies overnight (at least for a little while) are nothing new in our contemporary age. These programs exist in every single country and media market on the planet for a reason, so it stands to reason that films will be made with them as the centerpiece. Fierce has some fun portraying how these shows” storylines and competitors can consume polite society. Its dynamic, graphical visualization of the social media animal — bursts of ebullience when Marta is great; dismissal and nasiness when it all goes south — works well in Fierce, almost functioning as a character in itself. And it has a strong lead in Katarzyna Sawczuk, who plays well as both a surly teen and a talented singer. (Her Music Race take on “Chandelier” by Sia is sweeping and enormous.) Still, once Fierce has set up its central conceit — Marta hates Olo, Olo hates his life, social media feeds the fame monster– its momentum flags. Olo mopes around in his high-rise Warsaw apartment, having suddenly grown a conscience after ignoring the reality of Marta and her mom for almost 20 years. Marta is proud to stand up to Olo’s onstage ridicule, but turns so quickly toward notoriety, photo shoots, and forgetting about her friends back home, that we understand the rubber band will inevitably snap back to reality. With the time spent in between spinning in neutral, we are only left to wait for that moment of obvious resolution.

Fierce mines the emotional material where family and fame intersect. But it doesn’t dig deep enough to reveal anything that a few segments on an actual, real life singing show might explore with equal or greater heft.

Our Take: SKIP IT. Fierce is indeed that when its lead teen has fun tearing into her estranged father, and she impresses in a few of the performance sequences. But the film ultimately can’t fulfill its dual tracks of family drama and fame critique.",5.5,773," Comedy, Music ",Negative,0.935

L. James's 2012 novel of the same name. It is the third and final installment in the Fifty Shades film trilogy, following Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The film stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, and follows the couple as they marry, and must deal with Ana's former boss (Eric Johnson), who begins to stalk them.
Principal photography on Fifty Shades Freed began simultaneously with Darker in February 2016, in Paris and Vancouver. The film was released in the United States on February 9, 2018, including a limited IMAX release. It was a box office success, grossing over $370 million worldwide against a production budget of $55 million. It is the lowest-grossing film of the trilogy. Like its two predecessors, Fifty Shades Freed received negative reviews, with criticism for its screenplay and acting.","Section: Plot (1):
Newlyweds Christian and Anastasia are forced to cut their honeymoon short and return home after receiving news of a break-in at Christian's corporate headquarters. Some computer files were stolen and security camera tapes identify the perpetrator as Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss who was fired for sexual assault. Meanwhile, Ana is introduced to her new personal security team.
Christian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired an attractive architect, Gia Matteo, to rebuild it. Ana is annoyed when Gia openly flirts with Christian in Ana's presence. Ana privately threatens to fire Gia if she continues her flirting, forcing her to stop.
When Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she stay at home, and meets her friend, Kate Kavanagh, for a drink. Kate, who is dating Christian's older brother Elliot, confides that she suspects Elliot may be having an affair with Gia, who is also his business associate. When Ana returns home, she encounters Jack Hyde, who attempts to kidnap her. Ana's security team subdues him and he is arrested. After an argument with Christian about her night out with Kate, Ana berates Christian for being overly controlling and possessive and demands more freedom. Soon after, Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot, Mia, and José. Elliot proposes to Kate, who accepts. It is revealed that Gia was only helping Elliot choose the ring.
The newlyweds continue with their erotic sexual experimentation, but matters become complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant. Christian is deeply disturbed, saying he had other plans for their early years together. He leaves, going on a night-long drunken bender. After he returns, Ana discovers that Christian had texted and met his ex-lover and former BDSM dominant, Elena Lincoln. She becomes angry with Christian and locks herself in the playroom for the night. Christian searches for Ana in the morning and they continue arguing with Ana telling Christian how important the baby is for her.
Shortly after, Hyde, released on a $500,000 bond, phones Ana demanding a ransom for Mia, Christian's abducted sister. Hyde demands $5,000,000 in cash in two hours and threatens to kill Mia if his demands aren't met. He warns Ana to tell no one and to bring the money alone. Ana takes a checkbook and revolver from Christian's desk then goes to the bank to withdraw the full amount. The suspicious bank manager calls Christian. He thinks Ana is leaving him but then notices the coincidence of Hyde's recent release, Mia's unknown whereabouts, and Ana's sudden large cash withdrawal. Hyde instructs Ana to get into a car parked in the alley and to hand over her phone to the driver to discard. Ana tricks Hyde by taking the bank manager's phone and slipping her own phone into the bag of money. She exits the back entrance to discover that the driver and Jack's accomplice is her co-worker, Liz.
Ana arrives at the drop-off site with the money. Hyde, psychotic and vengeful, attacks Ana and kicks her abdomen. Liz tries to stop Jack as Ana pulls out the revolver and shoots Hyde in the leg. Christian and his security team, who electronically tracked Ana's cell phone, arrive and apprehend Hyde and Liz. Ana blacks out as she hears Christian's voice.
Ana awakens three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, Christian realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Christian's adoptive mother, Grace, assures Christian that Ana will not leave him. Ana returns home the next day. Christian's private investigator, Welch, has left a report showing that Christian and Hyde had shared the same foster family, though Christian has no memory of this. Hyde was vengeful over Christian being adopted by the wealthy Grey family instead of him. It is also learned that Hyde blackmailed Liz into being his accomplice. Christian and Ana also learn where Christian's birth mother is buried. They visit her grave and Christian lays flowers on it.
Seven months later, Christian and Ana have a son named Teddy and 3 years later Ana is pregnant with their second child.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 12%, based on 181 reviews, and an average rating of 3.08/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Fifty Shades Freed brings its titillating trilogy to a clumsy conclusion, making for a film franchise that adds up to a distinctly dissatisfying ménage à trois."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 43 critics, meaning ""generally unfavorable reviews."" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by Darker, while PostTrak reported that 56% of females (who made up 81% of the opening weekend audience) gave the film a ""definite recommend"".Writing for Variety, Guy Lodge was critical of the film, saying ""Indeed, a sex-free, PG-13 version of Freed could be cut without shedding a second of narrative coherence, such as it is; one could ask what the point of that would be, though similar queries might be leveled at the film as it stands."" Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave the film zero out of four, stating ""With this last entry, we have officially hit the bottom of the barrel. Whips, chains, butt plugs and nipple clips are nothing compared to the sheer torture of watching this movie."" Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film one out of five stars, and wrote ""This is a film in which one of the more emotionally detailed performances is given by a product-placement Audi.""Jeannette Catsoulis, writing for The New York Times, found the film to be significantly inferior to Kim Basinger's 9½ Weeks, stating: ""Layering a damp-squib thriller subplot beneath what appears to be an ad campaign for the one-percent lifestyle, the returning director and screenwriter test the newly married couple with an inconvenient pregnancy and an unconvincing car chase. There's an out-of-left-field abduction and a marital tiff over email addresses; but these narrative fragments, lazily tossed together alongside a neglected supporting cast, are no more than a flimsy causeway connecting bonking sessions.""Conversely, IndieWire reviewer Manuela Lazic gave the film three out of four stars, saying ""Finally, the Fifty Shades phenomenon has yielded a disarming comedy that makes this ridiculous material fun to watch.""

44,Full Out 2: You Got This!,United States,Deverett Media Group,,,,91,,,,,,,,"Let me tell you about this repellent Mexican comedy titled “Ahí te Encargo (You Got This)” but which should have been called “Two Selfish Jerks and a Baby.”

It’s a romance that tries to flip gender roles in a way Hollywood comedies did back in the ’80s, built around characters no sentient person could tolerate and a baby nobody seems to want to take care of.

It’s a movie that frowns at a young woman (Esmeralda Pimentel) hellbent on following her career wherever it takes her, and about her husband (Mauricio Ochmann), who barks, more than once, “Why won’t you give me what I want –a baby?”

It’s in Spanish with English subtitles, naturally. As if we couldn’t tell otherwise that this shiny, polished rom-com wouldn’t have been made, north of the border, any time after “Baby Boom” (1987).

Alejandro is a graphic designer for an ad agency with babies on the brain. Cecilia is a rising star at a global architectural engineering firm, with a chance to make partner and take over some day.

Events conspire to put a baby in his care “for a few days.” He’s offered a cute waitress and single mom free babysitting as a way of jumpstarting the maternal instincts in Ceci.

Which she plainly doesn’t have, and repeatedly reminds him that this is the case. So it’s no wonder he doesn’t tell her that he’s had the baby imposed on him, and hides the toddler from her.

She, on the other hand, can’t tell him about her possible dream promotion because they’re constantly fighting because “I want to have a baby and you won’t let me.”

Somehow, the bebe doesn’t seem like their biggest problem.

The gags here include Alejandro hiding the baby at work with the aid of his put-upon colleague (Matteo Giannini), both of them desperate to keep their loveless female boss, nicknamed “Mussolini,” from finding out. There’s a diaper disaster, or course.

“Yuck! Don’t let him eat it!”

Alejandro takes on a responsibility he’s not as prepared for as he thinks. Vintage VW Beetles with no child seat are no place for a toddler.

And Cecilia is already looking for apartments they can transfer to, in Hong Kong, without having that conversation with her husband.

Can this marriage be saved? Can this movie? Even with a squishy “things get serious” third act?

No. Nothing before that turn towards the darker aspects of life is the least bit funny.

Pharmacists “shaming” Rafa (Giannini) when he buys diapers, colleagues making the toddler their mascot, finding out the boss has found out what everybody calls her?

Not funny, not funny at all and give me a break.",4.7,333,Family,Negative,0.947

",,"Netflix movie Get the Goat (Cabras de Peste) is a Brazilian buddy cop action-comedy that prominently features an instrumental cover of Glenn Frey’s “The Heat is On,” immediately pointing to its spiritual influence, and no, it’s not The Sorrow and the Pity. Director Vitor Brandt Beverly Hills Cops his bright, cheery aesthetic from the Lethal Weapons and Tango and Cashes of the 1980s; now here’s hoping it’s not just Beverly Hills Slop.The Gist: Not much happens in the tiny village of Guaramobim near Sao Paolo, but one notable thing that happens is it annual rapadura festival, represented by its lovely, beloved goat mascot, Celestina. The police here are bored and sleepy, save for Bruceuilis (Edmilson Filho), who’s introduced with a splashy graphic identifying him as a “badass cop,” and yes, his name is pronounced “Bruce Willis,” and he has siblings named Chuquinorris and Vandami (and there are more, but I won’t burn all the jokes here). When Bruce’s overzealous pursuit of a perp committing a minor minor minor infraction results in a large-ish explosion, he’s demoted to goat-babysitting duty. Life is pain.

Meanwhile, in Sao Paolo, some REAL badass cops gear up to take down a big-time drug lord known only as the White Glove. Priscila (Leticia Lima) gives the doghouse-henhouse-outhouse speech, and inexplicably promotes inept schmoe Trindade (Matheus Nachtergaele) from low-stakes paper-pushing to a high-stakes undercover gig. Maybe she wants to see him get killed, but in fact, he gets his highly competent partner gunned down, prompting his demotion and a funeral sequence that strikes one as being of questionable taste. Again: life is pain.

REAL tragedy strikes when Celestina is kidnapped, bringing Bruce to the big city in pursuit. Circumstance finds him palling up with Trindade, and they stumblebum their way into a redemption opportunity when their path and the goat’s path crosses with the White Glove’s operation. Before you know it, Trindade and Bruce are good-cop-bad-copping their way through an interrogation, coaxing the goat to take a shit and pretending to be a gay couple as part of an undercover op. Hilarity ensues, theoretically.
What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: This is essentially the Brazilian Hot Fuzz.

Performance Worth Watching: The goat gets all the glamor shots and glory here.

Memorable Dialogue: “You did a great job. Well, not good. More like mediocre. Actually, it was lame.” — Priscila gets the honor of reviewing the movie via its own dialogue

Sex and Skin: None.

Our Take: There’s not much to Get the Goat — it’s a collection of fatigued jokes delivered by two affable lead actors functioning in a plot whose outcome is never in doubt for a second. It wears its affection for Stakeout, 48 Hrs., Rush Hour and the like on its sleeve, satirizing all the genre cliches at the same time it indulges them. It’s crude and silly and occasionally tacky, aiming for broad appeal but often missing even the broad side of the barn.

There’s something to be said for Filho and Nachtergaele’s performances, which don’t lack effort. They dive face first into slapstick and vulgarity with enough abandon and goodwill to endear us to them. But neither do they transcend the many Jackie Chan and Turner/Hooch tropes like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost did in Hot Fuzz — and that’s primarily a failing of Brandt and co-writer Denis Nielsen’s warmed-over material. It’s a classic case of homage deviating into pastiche.

46,Ghostbusters,United States,Columbia-Delphi Productions Black Rhino,Columbia Pictures,Bill Murray Dan Aykroyd Sigourney Weaver Harold Ramis Rick Moranis,Dan Aykroyd Harold Ramis,105,Ivan Reitman,30000000,296187079,"Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. It stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, a trio of eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. The film also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis, and features Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Ernie Hudson in supporting roles.
Based on his own fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project for himself and John Belushi. The protagonists would travel through time and space to combat a host of demonic and supernatural threats. Following Belushi's death, and with Aykroyd's concept deemed financially impractical, he was paired with Ramis to rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. Ghostbusters was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects. There was concern about the budget it would require and little faith in its potential for box office success. On an approximate $25–30 million budget, filming took place between October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles, and on sets at Burbank Studios, Los Angeles. Competition for special effects studios among various movies in development at the time meant part of the budget was used to co-found a new studio under Richard Edlund. He used a combination of practical effects, miniatures, and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals.
Ghostbusters was released on June 8, 1984, to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon. It was well-received for its deft blend of comedy, action, and horror, and Murray's performance was often singled out for praise. The film earned $282.2 million during its initial theatrical run, making it the second-highest-grossing film of that year, and the highest-grossing comedy of all time at that point. It was the number-one film in theaters for seven consecutive weeks and was one of only four films to gross more than $100 million that year. Further theatrical releases have increased the total gross to approximately $295.2 million, making it one of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Its theme song, ""Ghostbusters"" by Ray Parker Jr., was also a number-one hit.
With its effect on popular culture, and a dedicated fan following, the success of Ghostbusters launched a multi-billion dollar multimedia franchise. This includes the popular animated television series The Real Ghostbusters (which itself spawned a media franchise), its sequel series Extreme Ghostbusters, video games, board games, comic books, clothing, music, books, food, toys, collectibles, and haunted attractions. Ghostbusters was followed in 1989 by a sequel, Ghostbusters II, which fared less well financially and critically. Repeated attempts to develop a further sequel had ended following Ramis's death in 2014. A 2016 reboot, also called Ghostbusters, was released to mixed reviews and financial failure. A second, direct sequel, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, is scheduled for release in 2021.","Section: Plot (1):
Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler are scientists at Columbia University investigating the paranormal. Following their first encounter with a ghost manifesting at the New York Public Library, the university dean fires them and dismisses the credibility of their research. In response, they create ""Ghostbusters"", a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.
After a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett calls the Ghostbusters. She recounts opening her refrigerator and seeing a demonic dog-like creature that utters a single word: ""Zuul."" Ray and Egon research Zuul while Venkman offers to inspect Dana's apartment in a failed attempt to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly pre-test their equipment, Egon warns the group to never cross the energy streams of their proton pack weapons as it could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture their first ghost and deposit it in a containment unit in the firehouse. Paranormal activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous for their exploits; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand.
Suspicious of their operation, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment but is rebuffed by Venkman. Later, Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural activity is inexplicably increasing significantly. Venkman meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshiped as a servant to ""Gozer the Gozerian,"" a shape-shifting god of destruction. When Dana returns home she is possessed by Zuul; A similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Venkman arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be ""the Gatekeeper."" Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is ""Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster."" The Ghostbusters agree to keep the pair separated.
Peck returns with law-enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal Dana's building was designed by Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult, to function as an antenna for attracting and concentrating spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the end of the world. Faced with paranormal chaos in the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.
The Ghostbusters travel to the apartment building roof as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears in the form of a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, but disappears before they can retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters ""choose the form of the destructor."" Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears in the form of a giant, ""Stay Puft"" marshmallow man that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer's destructor form, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.

Section: Development (2):
Ghostbusters was inspired by Dan Aykroyd's fascination with and belief in the paranormal. This was inherited from his father (who wrote the book A History of Ghosts), his mother (who claimed she had seen ghosts), a grandfather (who experimented with using radios to contact the dead), and a great-grandfather (a renowned spiritualist). In 1981, he read an article on quantum physics and parapsychology in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, which gave him the idea of trapping ghosts. Aykroyd was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century made by teams like Abbott and Costello (Hold That Ghost (1941)), Bob Hope (The Ghost Breakers (1940)), and The Bowery Boys (Ghost Chasers (1951)).Aykroyd wrote the script, intending to star in it alongside Eddie Murphy and his close friend and fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) alumnus John Belushi, before Belushi's accidental death in March 1982. Aykroyd recalled: ""I was writing a line for John, and [producer and talent agent] Bernie Brillstein called and said they just found him … We loved each other as brothers."" He turned to another SNL former castmate, Bill Murray, who agreed to join the project, albeit without an explicit agreement, which is how he often worked. Aykroyd pitched his concept to Brillstein as three men who chase ghosts, and included a sketch of the ""Marshmallow Man"". He likened them to normal pest control workers, saying that ""calling a Ghostbuster was just like getting rats removed."" Aykroyd believed Ivan Reitman was the logical choice to direct, based on his successes with films like Animal House (1978) and Stripes (1981). Reitman was aware of the film's outline while Belushi was still a prospective cast member, and it took place in the future with many groups of intergalactic ghostbusters. He felt it ""would have cost something like $200 million to make."" Aykroyd's original 70- to 80-page script treatment was more serious in tone and was intended to be scary.Reitman met with Aykroyd at Art's Delicatessen in Studio City, Los Angeles and explained his concept would be impossible to make. He suggested setting it entirely on Earth would make the extraordinary elements more humorous and if they focused on realism from the beginning then the Marshmallow Man would be more believable by the end. Reitman also wanted to detail the Ghostbusters' origins before starting their business, saying ""this was beginning of the 1980s: everyone was going into business."" Following the meeting, the pair met Harold Ramis at Burbank Studios. Reitman had worked with him on previous films, and believed he could better execute the tone he intended for the script than Aykroyd. Reitman also felt Ramis should portray a ghostbuster; after he read the script Ramis joined the project immediately.Despite the script requiring considerable changes, Reitman pitched the film to Columbia Pictures executive Frank Price in March 1983. Price recounted finding the concept funny but the project itself controversial, as comedies were seen to have a ceiling on profitability. The film would require a big budget due to the special effects and a popular cast. Reitman said they could work with $25–$30 million; different figures have been cited. Price agreed as long as the film could be released by June 1984. Reitman admitted he made up the figure, basing it on three times the budget for Stripes, which seemed ""reasonable."" This left thirteen months to complete the film, with no script, effects studio, or filming start date. He hired Joe Medjuck and Michael C. Gross as associate producers, having collaborated with them previously. Columbia's CEO Fay Vincent sent his lawyer Dick Gallop to Los Angeles to convince Price not to pursue the film, but Price disagreed. Gallop returned to head office reporting Price was ""out of control.""Several titles were considered for the film since ""Ghostbusters"" was legally restricted by the Universal Studios-owned 1970s children's show The Ghost Busters. Options included ""Ghoststoppers,"" ""Ghostbreakers,"" and ""Ghostsmashers."" Fortunately, Price had parted ways with Columbia early in Ghostbusters' production and became head of Universal Pictures, at which point he sold Columbia the title for $500,000 plus 1% of the film's profits. Given Hollywood's accounting practices, however, the film technically never made a profit for Universal to be owed a payment.

Section: Writing (2):
Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman began reworking the script, first at Reitman's office before sequestering themselves and their families on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Aykroyd had a home there, and they worked day and night for about two weeks in his basement. He was understanding about the reworking of his script. He considered himself a ""kitchen sink"" writer who created the funny situations and paranormal jargon, while Ramis refined the jokes and dialogue. They wrote separately and then rewrote each other. Many scenes had to be cut, including an asylum haunted by celebrities, and an illegal ghost storage facility in a New Jersey gas station. Their initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, with a third and near-final draft ready by early August. When Murray later flew to New York after the filming of The Razor's Edge (1984) to meet Aykroyd and Ramis, he offered little input on the script or his character. Having written for Murray multiple times before, Ramis said he knew how to handle his character's voice.It was decided early on that Ramis' character would be the brains of the Ghostbusters, Aykroyd's was the heart, and Murray's was the mouth. Aykroyd drew inspiration from Hollywood archetypes, he said: ""Put [the characters of] Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler together, and you have the Scarecrow, the Lion, and the Tin Man."" Aykroyd's concept called for the Ghostbusters to have a boss and be directed into situations. Ramis preferred they be in control ""of their own destiny"" and make their own choices. This led to the development of more distinct identities for the  characters: Venkman as the cool, modern salesman; Stanz as the honest, enthusiastic technician; and Spengler as the factual, stoic intellectual.The most difficult part of the writing was determining the story's goal, who the villain was and their goal, why ghosts were manifesting, and how a towering Marshmallow Man appeared. The Marshmallow Man was one of many elaborate creatures in Aykroyd's initial treatment, originally intended to emerge from the East River only twenty minutes into the film. It stood out to Reitman but concerned him because of the relatively realistic tone they were taking. While this process was occurring, Reitman was searching for a special effects studio for the film, eventually recruiting Richard Edlund in the same two-week span.

Section: Casting (2):
Murray was considered essential to Ghostbusters' potential success, but he was known for not committing to projects until the last minute. Price agreed to fund Murray's passion project The Razor's Edge, believing if it failed it would lose very little money, but he hoped the gesture would secure Murray's commitment to Ghostbusters. Christopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, and Jeff Goldblum were considered to portray Egon. Ramis was inspired by the cover of a journal on abstract architecture for Egon's appearance. It featured a man wearing a three-piece tweed suit, wire-rim glasses, with his hair standing straight up. He took the character's first name from a Hungarian refugee he attended school with and the surname of historian Oswald Spengler. Apart from the three main stars, Medjuck was largely responsible for casting the other roles. Ernie Hudson went through about five auditions for the character of Winston Zeddemore. According to him, an earlier version of the script gave Winston a larger role as an Air Force demolitions expert with an elaborate backstory. Excited by the part, he agreed to the job for half his usual salary. The night before shooting began, he was given a new script with a greatly reduced role; Reitman told him the studio wanted to expand Murray's part. Aykroyd has said this was the role intended for Eddie Murphy, although Reitman refuted this. Gregory Hines was also considered for the part.Julia Roberts auditioned for the role of Dana Barrett, but it was Sigourney Weaver who attracted the filmmakers' attention. There was resistance to casting her because of the generally serious roles she played in Alien (1979) and The Year of Living Dangerously (1982). Weaver revealed her comedic background, developed at the Yale School of Drama, and began walking on all fours and howling like a dog. It was her suggestion Dana become possessed by the demonic dog, Zuul. Reitman said this solved issues with the last act by giving the characters personal stakes in the events. Weaver also changed the role from a model to a musician, saying she can be kind of strict, but ""you know she has a soul because she plays the cello.""John Candy was offered the role of Louis Tully. Candy told Reitman he did not understand the character, and suggested portraying Tully with a German accent and multiple German Shepherds; the filmmakers felt there were already enough dogs in the film. They and Candy passed on the casting. Reitman was already aware of Rick Moranis from their work together in Toronto and sent him the script. He accepted the role an hour later. Moranis developed many aspects of his character, including making him an accountant, and ad-libbed the lengthy speech at Tully's party. Sandra Bernhard turned down the role of Ghostbusters' secretary Janine Melnitz, which went to Annie Potts. As she arrived for her first day of filming, Reitman rushed Potts into the current scene. She quickly changed out of her street clothes and borrowed a pair of glasses worn by the set dresser. Her character ended up wearing the glasses throughout the film.William Atherton was chosen for the role of Walter Peck after appearing in the Broadway play Broadway. The role was described as akin to Margaret Dumont's role as a comedic foil to the Marx Brothers. Atherton said, ""It can't be funny, and I don't find [the Ghostbusters] in the least bit charming. I have to be outraged."" The role of the Sumerian god Gozer the Gozerian was originally intended for Paul Reubens, envisioned as a business-suited architect. Reubens passed on the idea, and it went to Yugoslavian actress Slavitza Jovan. The role changed to one inspired by the androgynous looks of Grace Jones and David Bowie. Paddi Edwards was uncredited as the voice of Gozer, dubbing over Jovan's strong Slavic accent.

Section: Filming (2):
Principal photography began in New York City on October 28, 1983. During the first day, Reitman brought Murray to the set, still unsure if he had read the script. Filming in New York lasted for about six weeks, finishing just before Christmas. Reitman was conscious they had to complete the New York phase before they encountered inhospitable December weather. At the time, choosing to shoot in New York City was considered risky. In the early 1980s, many saw the city as synonymous with fiscal disaster and violence, and Los Angeles was seen as the center of the entertainment industry. In a 2014 interview, Reitman said he chose New York because ""I wanted the film to be... my New York movie."" As Reitman was working with comedians, he encouraged improvisation, adapting multiple takes to keep cast inserts that worked, but directing them back to the script.Some guerrilla filmmaking took place, capturing spontaneous scenes at iconic locations around the city, including one shot at Rockefeller Center where the actors were chased off by a real security guard. A scene was shot in Central Park West with extras chanting ""Ghostbusters"" before the name had been cleared. Medjuck contacted the studio urging them to secure permission to use the word as the title.The building at 55 Central Park West served as the home of Weaver's character and the setting of the Ghostbusters' climactic battle with Gozer. The art department added extra floors and embellishments using matte paintings, models, and digital effects to create the focal point of ghostly activity. During shooting of the final scene at the building, city officials allowed the closure of the adjacent streets during rush hour, affecting traffic across a large swath of the city. Gross remarked that, from the top of the building, they could see traffic queuing all the way to Brooklyn. At various points, a police officer drew his gun on a taxi driver who refused orders; in a similar incident, another officer pulled a driver through his limo window. When angry citizens asked Medjuck what was being filmed, he blamed Francis Ford Coppola filming The Cotton Club. Aykroyd encountered science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, a man he admired, who complained: ""You guys are inconveniencing this building, it's just awful; I don't know how they got away with this!"" Directly next to 55 Central Park West is the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, which is stepped on by the Marshmallow Man.

Other locations included New York City Hall, the New York Public Library, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Tavern on the Green, Columbus Circle, the Irving Trust Bank on Fifth Avenue, and Firehouse, Hook & Ladder Company 8 in the Tribeca neighborhood used as the Ghostbusters' headquarters. Columbia University allowed its Havemeyer Hall to stand in for the fictional Weaver Hall, on the condition the university not be identified by name.Filming moved to Los Angeles, resuming just after Christmas and before the New Year. As the film used practical effects, they needed skilled technicians who resided mainly in the city and soundstages that were non-existent in New York. Despite its New York setting, most of Ghostbusters was filmed on location in Los Angeles or on sets at Burbank Studios. Location scouts searched for buildings that could replicate the interiors of buildings being filmed in New York. Reitman tried using the interior of Hook & Ladder 8, but was unable to take it over long enough because it was an active fire station. Interior firehouse shots were taken instead at the decommissioned Fire House No. 23 in downtown Los Angeles. The building design, while common in New York, was a rarity in Los Angeles. An archival photograph of an active crew in Fire House No. 23 from 1915 was hung in the background of the Ghostbusters' office.While filming took place in the main reading room of the New York Public Library (they could film only early and had to be out by 10:00 am), the basement library stacks were represented by the Los Angeles Central Library as Reitman said they were interchangeable. The stacks were destroyed in a 1986 fire. The Millennium Biltmore Hotel stood in for the scenes set at the fictional Sedgewick Hotel. Principal photography concluded at the end of January 1984, after between 55 and 62 days of filming.

Section: Post-production (2):
The short production schedule and looming June 8, 1984, release date meant Reitman was editing the film while shooting it. There was often time for only a few takes. Reitman sometimes found filming an effects-laden film frustrating, as the special effects had to be storyboarded and filmed in advance; there was no option to go back and film new scenes. As Gross described it: ""[Y]ou storyboard in advance, that's like editing in advance. You've got a scene, they're going to approve that scene, and we're going to spend nine months doing that cut. There's no second takes, no outtakes, there's no coverage. You can cut stuff, but you can't add stuff. It made him [Reitman] so confined that it really bothered him.""One of the deleted scenes involved a segment at ""Fort Detmerring"" where Ray has a sexual encounter with a female ghost. The scene was intended to introduce a love interest for Aykroyd. The feeling was it was extraneous to the fast-moving plot, however, so Reitman used the footage as a dream sequence during the mid-film montage instead. Editor Sheldon Kahn sent Reitman black-and-white reels of sequences during filming. They not only allowed him to make changes, but he considered they also helped him understand how to better pace the film. Kahn completed the first full cut of the film three weeks after filming concluded. The final cut of the film runs for 105 minutes.

Section: Music (2):
The Ghostbusters score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the 72-person Hollywood Studio Symphony orchestra at The Village in West Los Angeles, California. It was orchestrated by Bernstein's son Peter and David Spear. Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman's films and was hired before filming had begun or all the cast had been signed. Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny. Bernstein used the ondes Martenot (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a theremin) to produce the ""eerie"" effect. Bernstein had to bring a musician from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists. He also used three Yamaha DX7 synthesizers. In a 1985 interview Bernstein described Ghostbusters as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the film's varying comedic and serious tones. He created an ""antic"" theme for the Ghostbusters he described as ""cute, without being really way out."" He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound ""awesome and mystical.""Early on Reitman and Bernstein discussed the idea that Ghostbusters would feature popular music at specific points to complement Bernstein's original score. This included ""Magic"" by Mick Smiley, which plays during the scene when the ghosts are released from the Ghostbusters headquarters. Bernstein's main theme for the Ghostbusters was later replaced by Ray Parker Jr.'s ""Ghostbusters."" Bernstein personally disliked the use of these songs, particularly ""Magic"", but said ""it’s very hard to argue with something like [""Ghostbusters""], when it is up in the top ten on the charts.""Music was required for a montage in the middle of the film, and ""I Want a New Drug"" by Huey Lewis and the News was used as a temporary placeholder because of its appropriate tempo. Reitman was later introduced to Parker Jr. who developed ""Ghostbusters"" with a similar riff to match the montage. There were approximately 50 to 60 different theme songs developed for Ghostbusters by different artists before Parker Jr.'s involvement, though none was deemed suitable. Lewis was approached to compose the film's theme, but was already committed to work on Back to the Future (1985).

Section: Critical response (2):
Ghostbusters opened to generally positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, citing it as a rare example of successfully combining a special effects blockbuster with ""sly"" dialogue. Ebert noted the effects existed to serve the actors' performances and not the reverse, saying it is ""an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy."" He also cited Ghostbusters as a rare mainstream film with many quotable lines. Gene Siskel enjoyed the characters interacting with each other and praised Murray's performance in particular, saying his comedic sensibilities compensated for ""boring special effects"". He was critical of Hudson's late addition to the plot as Winston Zeddemore and the character's lack of development, saying it makes ""him appear as only a token box office lure.""Richard Schickel similarly praised Murray, and the grace of Aykroyd and Ramis in allowing Murray to outshine them. Schickel considered Murray's character Peter Venkman a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop fully his patented comic character."" He said the effects appear somewhat ""tacky"" and serve as a comic commentary on ghost films. Ultimately he believed praise was due to all involved for ""thinking on a grandly comic scale."" Dave Kehr countered Aykroyd and Ramis were ""curiously underutilized,"" but appreciated Murray's deadpan line readings. Kehr said Reitman is adept at improvisational comedy, but lost control of the film as the special effects gradually escalated.Arthur Knight appreciated the relaxed style of comedy saying while the plot is ""primitive,"" it has far more style and finesse than would be expected of the creative team behind Meatballs and Animal House. He singled out editors Sheldon Kahn and David Blewitt for creating a sustained pace of comedy and action. Despite ""bathroom humor and tacky sight gags"" Peter Travers said Ghostbusters was ""irresistible nonsense,"" comparing the film to the supernatural horror film The Exorcist, but with the comedy duo Abbott and Costello starring. Travers appreciated how Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis worked together.Joseph Gelmis described the Ghostbusters as an adolescent fantasy, comparing their firehouse base to the Batcave with a Fireman's pole and an Ectomobile on the ground floor. He said the film works as a collaborative effort by the three main Ghostbusters, particularly Murray, who dismisses the serious situations to keep them comedic. Deseret News' Christopher Hicks praised Reitman's improved directing skills, and the crew for avoiding the vulgarity found in their previous films, Caddyshack and Stripes. He felt they reached for more creative humor and genuine thrills instead. Hicks singled out Murray saying he ""has never been better than he is here."" He noted Murray, Ramis and Aykroyd ""wanted to be like the Marx brothers of the 80s."" He complained about the finale, claiming it lost its sense of fun and was ""overblown,"" but found the film compensated for this, since it ""has ghosts like you've never seen"".On a more critical note, Janet Maslin said Murray's talents were in service to a film lacking wit or coherence. She noted many of the characters had little to do, leaving their stories unresolved as the plot began to give way to servicing the special effects instead.  For Maslin, Ghostbusters worked during the small ghost-catching scenes, but was out of hand during the apocalyptic finale. However, she did praise Weaver's performance as an ""excellent foil"" for Murray. Variety said Ghostbusters mistakenly had top comedians but often had them working alone, calling it a ""lavishly produced"" film that is only periodically impressive. Variety also singled out Murray for his ""endearing"" physical comedy and ad-libbing. Newsweek's David Ansen enjoyed the film, describing it as a teamwork project where everyone works ""toward the same goal of relaxed insanity""; he called the film ""wonderful summer nonsense"". Pauline Kael had problems with the chemistry among the three lead actors. She praised Murray, but felt other actors did not have much material to contribute to the story; she concluded, ""Murray's lines fall on dead air.""

A sequel, Happy Death Day 2U, was released on February 13, 2019.","Section: Plot (1):
After a night of drunken partying, university student Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis. She ignores a phone call from her father and dismisses Carter, returning to her room. Her sorority housemate Lori Spengler gives her a cupcake, which she throws away. Tree meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the school mascot.
Tree immediately wakes up back in Carter's bed, and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she relives the day, this time avoiding the tunnel and reaching the party. However, the masked killer follows her and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes she is in a time loop, and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, already hiding inside, murders her a third time.
Waking up, Tree explains the events to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing people she considers suspects but is killed each time. After waking from a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. Her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple traumatic injuries, indicating she has retained physical damage from her previous deaths. When the killer shows up, Tree escapes the hospital in Gregory's car, only to be pursued and killed again.
Back in Carter's bed, Tree convinces him of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. Tree admits to harboring tremendous self-loathing, particularly from pushing away her father after the death of her mother three years ago. Tree sees a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she ends the loop, Tree hangs herself.
She awakens in Carter's dorm room and finds him alive again. Now confident in solving her murder, Tree proceeds happily through the day. She ends her affair with Dr. Butler and meets her father for lunch, where the two begin to reconcile. That night, she goes to the hospital and traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake Lori gave her.
Tree wakes up still in the loop. Horrified, she returns to her room with the intent to run away, where Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes the previous loop was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake, and she had died in her sleep. Tree realizes Lori is her true killer. Lori had poisoned the cupcake, but when Tree failed to eat it, Lori used her job as a nurse at the hospital to frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Tree threatens to take the cupcake to the police, but Lori attacks her. Lori admits to also having an affair with Dr. Butler, whose preference for Tree drove Lori mad with jealousy. In the ensuing fight, Tree stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth, then kicks her out a second-story window to her death.
At a restaurant, Tree and Carter muse over the day's events and he offers her his room for the night. The next day, Tree wakes up believing she is still in the time loop, but Carter quickly reveals he was just playing a prank on her, and it is really the next day. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him, and the two kiss.

The film was first announced in July 2007, with Megan Fox attached to star. The film was originally titled Half to Death, produced by Michael Bay and Rogue Pictures, and directed by Antti Jokinen. Christopher Landon was hired to rewrite the Scott Lobdell screenplay. Landon said, ""The movie was in pre-production or soft production at the time, and I came on and I loved the concept of the movie. I loved the idea of a girl, trapped in a time loop who has to solve her own murder."" The project was only revived years later, as original producer Angela Mancuso had lunch with Landon and remembered Half to Death. Landon decided to send the script to Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions, with whom he had worked in the Paranormal Activity sequels, and he approved it, leading to a green-light by Universal Pictures. Blumhouse announced the project on October 11, 2016, with Landon directing and Jessica Rothe cast in the lead role of the film. On November 8, 2016, it was announced that Ruby Modine, Charles Aitken and Rachel Matthews had joined the cast, alongside Rothe and Israel Broussard. The film got eventually retitled Happy Death Day in June 2017.The mask was constructed by Tony Gardner, the same man who built the ""Ghostface"" mask from every Scream film, and its design was personal. Landon explains, ""During preproduction ... I was expecting my first son. I don't know if I just had babies on the brain, or if I was subconsciously scared to become a father, but that baby image was floating around in my head. Tony made us a pig mask, too, but when I wore the baby mask in the office, I scared a co-worker, and we thought ... yeah, this is it. This is the one."" Scream itself was listed among the influences Christopher Landon took for the film, along with Halloween (1978), Groundhog Day and comedies of the 1980s such as Sixteen Candles and Back to the Future, given he aimed to make a ""fun, silly horror movie"". He also aimed to emulate the protagonist's personal growth in Groundhog Day to comment on ""this age of social media and all the crappy things that kids do to each other"".

Section: Writing (2):
Comic book writer Scott Lobdell said he wanted to play with the tropes of the slasher genre, as according to him ""every slasher film opens up with the mean girl getting killed and the good girl living till the end. And I thought, 'How can I make the mean girl and the good girl the same person?'"" In the original draft, Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers together. Landon says, ""They were a psycho couple murdering Tree together. That ultimately didn't work for me. I thought Gregory was a great opportunity to be a suspect. To make him a killer, it didn't help me. That was a change I really wanted to make."" Also, in the original draft there was no birthday, and no romance, which Landon added to humanize Tree. Landon decided to shorten the protagonist's name Teresa into Tree, which also conveyed her character arc, as ""trees need to grow and you see this character go from one person to another"".

Filming took place at and around Loyola University in New Orleans, Louisiana, and it lasted 5 weeks. The scenes where Tree awakens in Carter's bed after her death were filmed back to back in a span of two days. The scene after Tree pushes Lori out the window was supposed to be at the sorority house, but the filming permit was over before production was able to shoot there, forcing the location to be changed into a Los Angeles diner also featured in another Blumhouse production, Split.

Section: Original ending (2):
In the film's original ending, Tree is taken to the hospital after her encounter with Lori. The doctor instructs Tree to stay away from pain medication for at least a day due to the extent of her injuries. After he leaves, a nurse comes in and says she is giving Tree something for the pain. Tree informs the nurse of the doctor's orders. The nurse reveals herself to be Dr. Butler's wife, Stephanie, who says it is for her own pain. She then murders Tree in revenge for her husband's affair with the girl.
This version was shown in the test screenings for the film and was received negatively by the audience, which led the writers to come up with the theatrical ending. Director Christopher Landon also revealed Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers in the rough drafts, which later inspired the idea of the poisoned cupcake.

Reflecting the film's blend of horror and comedy, McCreary stated that he wanted ""a schizophrenic, dual personality, with light-hearted comedic scoring on one end, and genuinely terrifying soundscapes on the other."" This approach is highlighted by the two main leitmotifs, an energetic theme for Tree evoking contemporary pop music, and one for the killer that consists of distorted vocals provided by McCreary's young daughter Sonatin. The percussion in the score are mostly sampled from college marching band drum lines to evoke the collegiate setting. While the film's trailer featured 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"" as Tree's ringtone, Landon said the film could not afford to use the track, but still preferred the eventual song music supervisor Andrea von Foerster improvised, the comedic ""Busy Day Birthday"".

Critical response to Hillbilly Elegy was ""fairly negative"", but the performances of its cast received some praise. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 26% of 245 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.60/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""With the form of an awards-season hopeful but the soul of a bland melodrama, Hillbilly Elegy strands some very fine actors in the not-so-deep South."" According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 43 critics, the film received ""generally unfavorable reviews"".The Independent reported that the film was widely criticized for ""perpetuating stereotypes about the poor"". Katie Rife of the The A.V. Club called it a ""bootstrapping poverty porn"" and said that it ""reinforces the stereotypes it's meant to be illuminating.""Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote, ""As long as Close is acting up an award-worthy storm (her performance is actually quite meticulous), Hillbilly Elegy is never less than alive. Amy Adams does some showpiece acting of her own, but as skillful as her performance is, she never gets us to look at Bev with pity and terror."" Writing for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a ""C–"" and said, ""Hillbilly Elegy hinges on Mamaw's hope that she'll leave her family better off than she found them, and it's clear that Vance's story has fulfilled that wish almost as soon as this movie starts. But the process of watching him cut his losses and recommit to his own success is rendered in a way that it isn't just dramatically unsatisfying in the extreme, but also on the verge of sociopathic.""Peter Travers from Good Morning America thought the film was a ""missed opportunity"" but Close's performance was ""sensational"". He concluded, ""With greater emphasis on simplicity instead of Hollywood showboating, Hillbilly Elegy might have been more than a missed opportunity."" In her positive review, Sandra Hall from The Sydney Morning Herald praised Howard's ""high-end brand of commercial movie-making"" and opined that he's ""to be applauded just for inviting Close, with her wealth of imagination and technique, to give us everything she has."" Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a perfect 4 out of 4 star rating, praising Adams' and Close's ""exceptional work"", describing Adams as a ""tour de force"" and Close as ""masterful, screen-commanding, pitch-perfect.""Rahul Desai of Film Companion wrote, ""The film is shameless Oscar-bait.

Seaman,105,Ron Howard,123000000,363597184,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas (also known as Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas and simply The Grinch) is a 2000 American Christmas fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Ron Howard and written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. Based on Dr. Seuss's 1957 book of the same name, it was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film. The film is narrated by Anthony Hopkins and stars Jim Carrey in the title role along with Taylor Momsen (in her feature film debut), Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon in supporting roles. 
Because the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline in order to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed and several new rhymes were put in. The film also borrowed some music and character elements that originated in the 1966 animated television special, such as the song ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" and the Grinch's green skin tone.
Produced by Howard and Brian Grazer's Imagine Entertainment, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on November 17, 2000 to mixed reviews, with critics praising the production values (particularly the makeup), Carrey's portrayal of the titular character, and James Horner's musical score, but criticizing the script, characters, innuendos and inconsistent tone. It was a huge commercial success nonetheless, grossing $363 million worldwide and becoming the sixth-highest grossing film of 2000. It was originally the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind Home Alone (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the third film adaptation of the story. It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup as well as getting nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.","Section: Plot (1):
All the Whos of Whoville enjoy celebrating Christmas. Everybody except, The Grinch .
Years later, nobody likes the Grinch because of his mean-spiritedness, especially at Christmastime. But six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She encounters the Grinch at the post office and later discovers he has a tragic past.
The Grinch arrived in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. He was a timid child and wasn't cruel as he would later become. In school when he was eight years old he had a crush on Martha May Whovier who was a beautiful girl in his class who seemed to like him back. Bully Augustus MayWho however was jealous that Martha liked The Grinch and began to pick on him.  That Christmas he made a gift for Martha but accidentally cut his face trying to shave after MayWho saw he had a beard. When MayWho and his classmates (except for Martha) saw his cut face they made fun of him causing him to hate Christmas. He fled and exiled to Mount Crumpit.  
Cindy nominates the Grinch to be the town's ""Holiday Cheermeister"", much to the displeasure of Augustus MayWho, who is now the mayor of Whoville. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration and he eventually accepts. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins to have fun, but Mayor MayWho spoils everything by giving him an electric razor as a present reminding him of his childhood humiliation. The Mayor then publicly proposes marriage to Martha and giving her a gaudy engagement ring and a new car. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos for their materialism by telling them that Christmas is only about gifts that they will ultimately end up throwing in the garbage, which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He burns down the tree with a makeshift flamethrower (the Whos, however have a spare) and goes on a rampage before returning home to Mt. Crumpit.
Finally fed up with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch concocts a plan to crush the Whos' Christmas spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they're sleeping. He disguises himself as Santa Claus and dresses his pet dog Max as a reindeer, then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and lies to Cindy when she catches him stealing their tree, allowing him to escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back to the top of Mt. Crumpit to destroy it all by pushing the sack off the side. When the Whos wake up on Christmas morning, they are horrified to discover the theft and Mayor MayWho blames Cindy for letting the Grinch ruin the holidays for the town. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, comes to his daughter's defense by explaining to the mayor and all of the other Whos that he has finally figured out what Cindy has been trying to tell the whole town — Christmas is mainly about being together with family and friends, not just gifts and fancy decorations. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.
Before the Grinch can push the sack of stolen gifts off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then has an epiphany and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes. The sleigh full of gifts then begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return everything.
The Grinch apologizes for his pranks and the burglary before surrendering himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny the mayor's request to arrest and pepper spray him. Martha even turns down his proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that her heart belongs to the Grinch. Afterwards, the redeemed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.

Before his death in 1991, Dr. Seuss had refused offers to sell the film rights to his books. However, his widow Audrey Geisel, agreed to several merchandising deals, including clothing lines, accessories and CDs. In July 1998, Geisel's agents announced via letter she would auction the film rights of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. In order to pitch their ideas to Geisel, the suitors ultimately had to be willing to pay $5 million for the material and hand over 4 percent of the box-office gross, 50 percent of the merchandising revenue and music-related material, and 70 percent of the income from book tie-ins. The letter also stated that ""any actor submitted for the Grinch must be of comparable stature to Jack Nicholson, Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman."" Additionally, it was stipulated that the estate would not consider a director or writer who had not earned at least $1 million on a previous picture.20th Century Fox pitched its version with director Tom Shadyac and producers Dave Phillips and John Davis in attendance, in which Nicholson was in mind to play the Grinch. Additionally, the Farrelly brothers and John Hughes pitched their own separate versions. Universal Pictures held its pitch presentation with Brian Grazer and Gary Ross in attendance, but Geisel refused each offer. Grazer then enlisted his producing partner Ron Howard to help with the negotiations. At the time, Howard was developing a film adaptation of The Sea-Wolf, and, despite being an avid fan of the animated special, did not express interest in Grinch but Grazer talked Howard into traveling to Geisel's residence for the pitch meeting. While studying the book, Howard became interested in the character Cindy Lou Who and pitched a film in which she would have a larger role as well as a materialistic representation of the Whos and an expanded backstory of the Grinch.On September 16, 1998, it was announced that Howard would direct and co-produce a live-action adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas with Jim Carrey attached to star. It was also reported that Universal Pictures, who had acquired the distribution rights, paid $9 million for the film rights for an adaptation of Grinch and Oh, the Places You'll Go! to Geisel. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (of both Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Doc Hollywood fame) wrote the final screenplay following eight drafts, but Geisel also had veto power over the script. She objected to several jokes and sexual innuendos in the screenplay, including one about a family who did not have a Christmas tree or presents jokingly called the ""Who-steins"" and the placement of a stuffed trophy of the Cat in the Hat on the Grinch's wall. Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer (who were also writers on the television series Seinfeld) did an uncredited rewrite of the script.The film was shot between September 1999 and January 2000. Geisel visited the set in October 1999. Much of the Whoville set was constructed on the backlot of Universal Studios behind the Bates Motel set from Psycho. Rick Baker was hired to design and create the film's prosthetic makeup for Carrey and the rest of the cast. It took a number of tests, and ultimately Carrey admiring a photo of Baker in his first test makeup, for the decision to use Baker's original makeup design. The Grinch suit was covered in yak hair, dyed green and sewed onto a spandex suit. The application of the makeup took up to 8 and a half hours, after which a frustrated Carrey kicked a hole in the wall of his trailer. Carrey's makeup artist Kazu Hiro recounted, ""On set, [Carrey] was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn't finish. After two weeks we only could finish three days' worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart. We couldn't shoot anything."" Kazu Hiro left production until Baker and Howard had a discussion with Carrey on how important Kazu Hiro was to the production. Carrey agreed to keep his anger in check and Kazu Hiro returned to his role. Meanwhile, Josh Ryan Evans, who played the 8-year old Grinch, wore the same style of makeup and bodysuit that Carrey wore. In total, Carrey spent 92 days in the Grinch makeup and became adept at remaining calm while sitting in the make-up chair. Most of the appliances the actors wore were noses that connected to an upper lip along with a few dentures, ears and wigs.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A–"" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, referring to it as ""a dank, eerie, weird movie about a sour creature"" and said, ""There should be ... a jollier production design and a brighter look overall ... It's just not much fun."" Ebert observed that Carrey ""works as hard as an actor has ever worked in a movie, to small avail"". Nevertheless, he decided that ""adults may appreciate Carrey's remarkable performance in an intellectual sort of way and give him points for what was obviously a supreme effort"".Paul Clinton of CNN declared that Carrey ""was born to play this role"" and noted that ""Carrey carries nearly every scene. In fact, if he's not in the scene, there is no scene."" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly began his review of the film analyzing the Grinch's ""mischievously divided, now-I'm-calm/ now-I'm-a-raving-sarcastic-PSYCH-o! personality"" and summed up Carrey's Grinch as ""a slobby, self-loathing elitist ruled by the secret fear that he's always being left out of things."" Gleiberman expressed surprise at ""how affecting Carrey makes the Grinch's ultimate big-hearted turnaround, as Carrey the actor sneaks up on Carrey the wild-man dervish. In whichever mode, he carreys  [sic] the movie.""Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle said, ""Nobody could play the Grinch better than Jim Carrey, whose rubbery antics and maniacal sense of mischief are so well suited to How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Dr. Seuss himself might have turned to Carrey as a model for the classic curmudgeon had the actor been around in 1957."" However, he wondered why Carrey ""made himself sound like Sean Connery"" and warned that the character's intensity may frighten small children. James Berardinelli of ReelViews wrote that Carrey's ""off-the-wall performance is reminiscent of what he accomplished in The Mask, except that here he never allows the special effects to upstage him. Carrey's Grinch is a combination of Seuss' creation and Carrey's personality, with a voice that sounds far more like a weird amalgamation of Sean Connery and Jim Backus (Bond meets Magoo!) than it does Karloff."" He concluded that Carrey ""brings animation to the live action, and, surrounded by glittering, fantastical sets and computer-spun special effects, Carrey enables Ron Howard's version of the classic story to come across as more of a welcome endeavor than a pointless re-tread.""Some reviews were more polarized. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon in a generally negative review of the film, wrote that ""Carrey pulls off an admirable impersonation of an animated figure ... It's fine as mimicry goes – but mimicry isn't the best playground for comic genius. Shouldn't we be asking more of a man who's very likely the most gifted comic actor of his generation?"" She concluded that in spite of ""a few terrific ad-libs ... his jokes come off as nothing more than a desperate effort to inject some offbeat humor into an otherwise numbingly unhip, nonsensical and just plain dull story"".Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, ""Carrey tries out all sorts of intonations, vocal pitches and delivery styles, his tough guy posturing reminding at times of Cagney and his sibilant S's recalling Bogart. His antic gesturing and face-making hit the mark at times, but at other moments seem arbitrary and scattershot. Furthermore, his free-flowing tirades, full of catch-all allusions and references, are pitched for adult appreciation and look destined to sail right over the heads of pre-teens.""

",,,," We know what you’re thinking: not another serial killer movie. On paper, it’s worse than that: it’s yet another serial killer movie about a serial killer who hunts serial killers. See Dexter, Repairman Jack, et al. Happily, Billy O’Brien, the Irish director behind the underrated rural horror Isolation (2006), has fashioned a sour, wicked film that neither looks nor feels like the rest of the busy sub-genre.

 John Wayne Cleaver (Where the Wild Things Are’s Max Records) is a small-town Minnesota teenager whose love of mass murderers has convinced him, but not his psychologist, that he is, in fact, a serial killer in waiting.

 A social outcast, John’s obsession is not helped by the fact that his mother April (Laura Fraser) owns a funeral home, where, of late, strangely mutilated bodies have been arriving. Intrigued and ready to sleuth, John gets on the case and fixes on Mr Crowley (Christopher Lloyd), an elderly neighbour, as his prime suspect.   He soon starts helping the old man and his wife around the house, hoping to prove that Crowley is not as jolly or feeble as he seems to be. The truth, when it is revealed, is far weirder than anything John’s admittedly over-active imagination might have come up with.

A muffled tone, not unlike George Romero’s Martin, and an initially slow-burning drama finally tips into a gloopy final stand-off between Records and Lloyd. Back to the Future diehards might want to look away: three seasons of Rick and Morty may not have altered your perception of Doc Brown, but I Am a Serial Killer is a game-changer.

",,,,"It seems like centuries ago that Marco Bellocchio’s Mafia drama made its modestly buzzy premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The movie has become no less of a conundrum on its journey to our smaller screens.

Bellocchio last appeared at Cannes a decade earlier with the impressively busy Vincere, a riotous, noisy, shocking study of the young Mussolini. The prospect of those energies being applied to this true-life yarn – an insider testifies against the mob and experiences various traumas over two decades – is a tantalising one.

The Traitor has all the trappings of an indecently immoral entertainment. Yet it has turned out be oddly flattened. Too much is taken up with uninteresting muttering in the shadows. Secondary characters are insufficiently developed. The lengthy courtroom scenes in the later stages ultimately become suffocating.The picture tells us how Tommaso Buscetta (Pierfrancesco Favino) went from high-ranking Cosa Nostra operative to the most damaging of snitches. In 1980, the anti-hero (I guess) moves from Sicily to Brazil as drug wars threaten to eat up the competing clans. He finds no peace. The deaths at home keep mounting up and he is arrested by the Brazilian police. He decides to seek immunity and testify against his old colleagues. The welcome is decidedly cool when he returns to Italy.he performance by Favino is an unqualified success. An enigma riding out on waves of hair-oil, the gangster hides so many of his motivations behind a face apparently carved from the native minerals of Palermo. Favino has enough charisma to animate even such a concealed personality.

One yearns to have a more interesting film around him. The issue is partly one of style. Vladan Radovic’s camera savours the enveloping darkness, but the scenes he shoots are played out at the pace of a scooter with a wonky wheel. A more serious problem is the film’s reluctance to translate its researches into drama.

Buscetta was one of the first prominent Mafia pentitos – informants of elevated status – and the facts behind his turning are worth conveying. But this is not a documentary. Too often we seem to be sitting through transcriptions of hearings or staged readings of contemporaneous newspaper reports. Make a story of it, man.

The picture still holds the eye, but there is something much more gripping bursting to get out.

",,,,"Rome, 1952. The young ministerial official Furio Momenté is summoned by his superior for a very delicate matter. In Veneto, a minor killed a peer convinced he was killing the devil. For electoral reasons, the issue must be dealt with in such a way as to avoid scandals. The victim's mother is very powerful and, as a supporter of the cause of the political majority, she has changed her opinion by taking a very critical position towards the Church and those who politically support her. Momenté's task is therefore to avoid the involvement of members of the clergy in the ongoing criminal proceedings. During the long train journey, Momenté reads the reports of the interrogations conducted by the investigating judge, starting with that of the little murderer, Carlo. The reality that begins to unfold before him is complex and sinister, but once he gets there, things will prove far worse.

Pupi Avati has made a name for itself above all with bittersweet comedies that have masterfully grasped human nature and the feelings that animate it. But, without considering the finely grotesque register that characterized his very personal beginnings, Avati also left an indelible mark on Italian horror, creating a handful of masterpieces capable of creating a sort of sub-genre that has been defined as Po Valley Gothic.

Avati has signed horror masterpieces to such an extent that it has repeatedly caused the regret that he has not devoted himself more often to the genre, no matter how beautiful and important his other films have been. Therefore, every time Avati returns to horror, the anticipation and expectations can only be high. And when expectations are high, disappointments are just around the corner. However, this is not the case because with Mr. Devil Avati gets almost everything right and creates another of his gothic masterpieces rich in nuances and evident or hidden meanings.

The completely Avatian ability to invent details of absolute and original macabre charm is highlighted once more in this film in which the characters often appear very different from what they are and the helpless protagonist, projected from afar into a reality he does not know, he has to try with great effort to find the key to a skein that becomes more and more tangled in his hands, a bit like the Lino Capolicchio of La casa delle windows che laughing, an unforgotten horror by Avati over forty years ago.

The rural setting in those 50s that seem to belong to a non-time in which time has stopped recalls, albeit with geographical and temporal differences, that progenitor of the Po Valley Gothic and reaffirms with strength and power as the innocence of living peasant is a cliché that is not at all true. Rather. The atmosphere that Avati creates is one of profound restlessness, always poised between supernatural and superstition: ""In peasant culture"" says one of the characters, ""the different, the deformed are associated with the devil"".

Pictures, New Line Cinema and Walden Media to mixed reviews, but was a box office success with a worldwide gross of $335 million, surpassing its predecessor. It was released on DVD/Blu-ray on June 5, 2012.","Section: Plot (1):
It has been four years since the previous adventure. Seventeen-year-old Sean is caught by the police after a brief chase on his dirtbike. His stepfather Hank arrives when a police officer friend calls him, explaining that Sean had broken into a satellite control center.
Hank discovers that Sean accessed the satellites in hopes of enhancing a coded signal he suspects was sent by his long-missing grandfather, Alexander Anderson. Wanting to bond with his stepson, Hank helps decipher the code of Jules Verne characters which lead to three books: Treasure Island, Gulliver's Travels, and Verne's own Mysterious Island. Using the books' individual island maps, Hank uses a backlight to make them a single island, complete with the coordinates to its location. Hank manages to convince wife Liz to let him take Sean in search of the island to bond with him, but also slightly hoping to prove to Sean that there is no mysterious island there.
They arrive in Palau, where Hank reluctantly hires helicopter tourism guide Gabato and his daughter Kailani (on whom Sean develops an immediate crush) to fly to the coordinates for $3000, as they are the only ones willing to take them. The helicopter gets caught in a cyclone and they crash into the Pacific, waking up on the island.
Moving inland, they are shocked to discover miniature elephants and giant butterflies. When they come across an egg clutch belonging to a vicious giant frilled lizard, Gabato accidentally wakes up the giant frilled lizard, which chases them throughout the jungle, on the warpath against them. They nearly get eaten, but are saved by Alexander. He takes them to a hut he built from the wreckage of the ship that brought him to the island. He has a working radio, but due to the positioning of the satellite, it will be two weeks before they can call out.
The next morning, Alexander leads the group to the lost city of Atlantis, which he calculates re-submerges every 70 years, for an extended period. When Hank discovers sea water appearing from the ground, he concludes that the island will sink in a couple of days. Their only means of salvation seems to be the legendary Nautilus, Captain Nemo's submarine. Kailani enters Nemo's crypt and finds his journal, which shows that Nautilus is in a cave at Poseidon's Cliffs.  They decide to go there through the center of the island as it is the quickest but it is also the dangerous way to the other side of the island.
To cross the mountainous island, they mount giant bees to fly over a high ridge and makeup time. When giant bee-eater birds try to devour them, Sean saves Kailani's life, but dislocates his ankle. Hank and Alexander reset Sean's ankle, then the group has a bonding moment when Hank sings his rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"" to ease Sean's pain.
The next morning, the water has risen greatly and Hank deduces that the island will sink in a matter of hours. Gabato is missing, having gone toward the island's golden volcano in search of gold to give his daughter a better life. While Alexander and Kailani go after him, Sean and Hank head for Poseidon's Cliffs. Alexander also finally calls Hank by his preferred name, rather than ""Henry"", and the two fully bond.
To reach Nautilus' underwater cave, Sean and Hank create makeshift oxygen tanks and dive down fifty feet, but are nearly killed by a giant electric moray eel. The 140-year-old batteries have run down, so they engineer a way to start the submarine with the eel's electricity.
Kailani and Alexander find Gabato and convince him to escape with them instead of trying for the golden volcano. As they near Poseidon's Cliffs, the volcano violently erupts, creating lava flows and ejecting flaming lava bombs. Sean and Hank arrive in Nautilus just in time to rescue the others from the water. Gabato pilots the submarine out of harm's way while Hank and Sean fire torpedoes into the path of falling island debris. As they clear the dangers, Kailani kisses Sean for his bravery.
Six months later, Kailani and Gabato are well off, as he runs the most popular tourist attraction on Palau – tours aboard the Nautilus. Kailani visits Sean on his birthday. While the family celebrates, Alexander arrives with a book for Sean's birthday present – Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon, Alexander's suggestion for the next new adventure with the family.

It is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise and the first in the Jurassic World trilogy. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Derek Connolly and Trevorrow, and produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, the film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Irrfan Khan. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. A successful theme park of cloned dinosaurs, dubbed Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing John Hammond's dream to fruition. The park plunges into chaos when a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage, while a group of trained Velociraptors are utilized in neutralizing it.
Universal Pictures intended to begin production of a fourth Jurassic Park film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but was in development hell while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer Steven Spielberg, writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in Louisiana and Hawaii. The dinosaurs were created by Industrial Light & Magic using CGI and by Legacy Effects using life-sized animatronics. Production was completed in May 2015.Jurassic World was released in the United States on June 12, 2015. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $1.6 billion in box office revenue, reaching third among the highest-grossing films of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the highest-grossing in the franchise. The sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, was released in June 2018. Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous, an animated series set concurrently with the events of Jurassic World, was released in September 2020 on Netflix. A third film, Jurassic World: Dominion, will see release in June 2022.","Section: Plot (1):
Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park on Isla Nublar, of which their aunt Claire Dearing is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant Zara as the boys' guide, but they evade her and explore on their own. 
Elsewhere on the island, former Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training a quartet of Velociraptors composed of Blue, Echo, Delta, and Charlie, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, head of InGen security Vic Hoskins believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry vehemently oppose.
Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, the Indominus rex, a transgenic dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that the Indominus lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When the Indominus has apparently escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen advises Masrani to have the Indominus destroyed, but to protect his company's investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry, so it can safely be returned to its paddock. After most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.
While exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys the vehicle but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old Jeep Wrangler, and drive back to the park resort. 
As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the Indominus as well. Masrani and two troopers hunt down the Indominus by helicopter, but it breaks into the park's aviary.  The aviary's pterosaurs crash Masrani's helicopter, killing all three inside, before converging onto the resort, and terrorizing many of the visitors, including Zara who is then devoured by the resident Mosasaurus. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down the pterosaurs.
Assuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the Indominus, with or without Owen's cooperation, where Owen reluctantly goes along with it and spearheads the assault with the raptors. Upon finding the Indominus, the dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the Indominus has Velociraptor DNA and it takes away Owen's command of the raptors, becoming the pack's new alpha. Troops fire on the Indominus, but it escapes. The raptors slaughter most of the troops, while Charlie is killed in the chaos. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him.
Owen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the Indominus reappears. They attack the hybrid, but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus rex, the park's veteran attraction, from its paddock and lures it into a battle with the Indominus. The Indominus quickly gains the advantage over the Tyrannosaurus until Blue recovers and joins the battle. The duo overpower the Indominus until it gets cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the Mosasaurus. 
The survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned once again. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together.

Section: Development (2):
In May 2001, Steven Spielberg had Amblin Entertainment commence development of ideas for Jurassic Park IV, which he planned to produce. Initially, Jurassic Park III director Joe Johnston was not interested in directing the fourth film. In 2002, William Monahan was announced as screenwriter, and a release date was set for mid-2005. Kathleen Kennedy would produce the film, and Spielberg would serve as executive producer.An early story idea would partially involve dinosaurs migrating to the Costa Rican mainland. A team of experts, including Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ian Malcolm, would chart an expedition to an offshore island and discover the dinosaurs breeding freely. Part of the plot would involve the characters devising a way to restrict the spread of the dinosaurs and prevent an ecological disaster. Early concept art also depicted genetically engineered human-dinosaur mercenaries. Monahan's first draft of the script was finished in July 2003; the story was not set in a jungle, as in previous films. Monahan subsequently left the project to work on Kingdom of Heaven. In 2004, Frank Marshall joined the project as a producer, and Monahan was replaced by John Sayles, who wrote two drafts of the script. In one draft, a new character, a mercenary named Nick Harris, would be charged with training a team of genetically modified Deinonychus for use on rescue missions and to combat drug dealers. The concept of a human who trains dinosaurs came from Spielberg. By April 2005, the film had been postponed, as Spielberg was dissatisfied with the script revisions.Progress on the film stalled during 2005 as Marshall and Spielberg were busy with other film projects. In 2006, Spielberg said Johnston would direct the film. Additional work on the film was expected to begin following the release of a fourth Indiana Jones film, which Marshall and Spielberg were working on. By April 2007, Johnston was no longer involved as director. A release date of 2008 was expected, but was later delayed to 2009. By 2010, Johnston was involved with the project again and planned for the film to be the first in a new Jurassic Park trilogy. Johnston hoped to further develop the project with Spielberg after they finished other projects, including Johnston's 2011 film, Captain America: The First Avenger.In 2011, writer Mark Protosevich was hired. He wrote two story treatments, neither of which were approved. Spielberg and Kennedy felt that the film did not yet have an adequate story. In 2012, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver were hired to write the script. The writers incorporated three ideas from Spielberg: a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, a human who has a relationship with trained raptors (from Sayles's earlier draft), and a human-eating dinosaur that escapes and has to be stopped.

In January 2013, Universal set a release date of June 13, 2014. In February 2013, it was announced that Kennedy would not produce the film, as she would be busy with the upcoming Star Wars sequel trilogy. A month later, Colin Trevorrow was hired as director, and Patrick Crowley was announced as a producer alongside Marshall. Trevorrow and his writing partner, Derek Connolly, rewrote the earlier draft by Jaffa and Silver, while retaining Spielberg's three story ideas. The film's release was delayed by a year to give the writers time to perfect the script. Universal announced in September 2013 that the film would be titled Jurassic World, with a release scheduled for June 12, 2015. The film is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, and is considered a direct sequel to that film; although The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III remain canon in the series, Jurassic World ignores their events as they occurred on a different island location.Between 2003 and 2008, several cast members from previous Jurassic Park films were expected to reprise their roles, including Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, and Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler. Attenborough retired from acting following a fall at his house in 2008. A statue of his character is featured in the film. Trevorrow and Connolly did not want to bring back the other characters unless there would be a good reason for them to be involved in the story; they considered Dr. Henry Wu, the scientist responsible for recreating dinosaurs, a logical choice.Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson were cast as the child characters in October 2013. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt were cast in the lead roles. Vincent D'Onofrio and Irrfan Khan were cast in early 2014, and BD Wong was announced to be reprising his role of Dr. Henry Wu, marking the character's first appearance since the original Jurassic Park film in 1993.

Principal photography began on April 10, 2014, in Hawaii. Filming locations there included the islands of Kauai and Oahu. The Indominus rex enclosure was among the shooting locations in Hawaii. Filming continued in Hawaii until June 2014, before moving to Louisiana. The Main Street and boardwalk area of the fictional Jurassic World theme park was constructed in the parking lot of the abandoned Six Flags New Orleans park. NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans was also used to construct interior sets representing the Jurassic World park. Other sets constructed at the facility included a Mosasaurus feeding show and a raptor enclosure.The film includes a scene in which Claire's assistant Zara (portrayed by Katie McGrath) is carried off by several Pteranodon before falling into the park's lagoon, where she is eaten by the Mosasaurus, marking the first female death in the series. Trevorrow wanted to make it ""the most spectacular death we can possibly imagine"", while also wanting to surprise moviegoers, stating, ""Let's have someone die who just doesn't deserve to die at all.""Stan Winston provided animatronic dinosaurs for the previous Jurassic Park films, and intended to do the same for the fourth film prior to his death in 2008. Instead, Winston's former colleagues at Legacy Effects provided an animatronic Apatosaurus for the film. Maquettes were used to depict the velociraptors during certain scenes, and some dinosaurs were created through the use of motion capture. The remaining dinosaurs were computer-generated by Industrial Light & Magic. Filming concluded on August 5, 2014.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Jurassic World has an approval rating of 71% based on 351 reviews and an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Jurassic World can't match the original for sheer inventiveness and impact, but it works in its own right as an entertaining -- and visually dazzling -- popcorn thriller."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five and said it is a ""terrifically enjoyable and exciting summer spectacular"" and ""savvy, funny, ridiculous in just the right way"". Robbie Collin of The Telegraph also awarded it four stars, deeming it a worthy sequel to the original Jurassic Park and calling it ""methodically paced and shot with an awestruck visual sense that's pure Spielberg"". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it three stars out of four and wrote; ""It's not the cynical, cash-in cheesefest you feared. OK, Jurassic World is a little of that. But this state-of-the-art dino epic is also more than a blast of rumbling, roaring, 'did you effing see that!' fun."" He praised Trevorrow's direction, Pratt's and Howard's performances and the effects. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said the film wasn't ""terribly scary"" and criticized the romance between Owen and Claire, but he praised the CGI implementation and the film's musical score.The Associated Press rated the film two stars out of four, calling it ""an ugly, over-saturated movie"" that lacks the ""deft sense of wonderment, wit and suspense that guided the original"". The review praised Pratt and Howard's performances, however. Spielberg said, ""To see Jurassic World come to life is almost like seeing Jurassic Park come true,"" while Sam Neill also praised the film and its acting. Several news publications, as well as Neill, noted the violence of Zara's death scene, both critically and favourably, with some reviewers expressing concerns about sexism or misogyny in the film's handling of the franchise's first notable depiction of a woman being killed onscreen, although Entertainment Weekly wrote, ""There's nothing amusing about the demise of Zara, who's as close to 'real people' as Jurassic World gets, and it's that unsettling quality about her death that more Hollywood disaster epics need in order to reclaim their visceral emotional prowess"". Additionally, several news outlets, including The New York Times, New York and Slate, considered the film's depiction of Claire, including her use of high heels throughout the film, to be sexist. UK film website Movie Metropolis called Jurassic World a tasteful homage to the original but said it lacks some of that film's soul and rated it four stars out of five.Several journalists have noted plot and character similarities between Jurassic World and the 1999 film Deep Blue Sea. Christopher Rosen, Senior News Director at Entertainment Weekly, tweeted that ""Jurassic World is my favorite Deep Blue Sea remake of 2015"". Entertainment website Dark Horizons stated in its coverage of Jurassic World that ""some aren't warming to the Deep Blue Sea meets Jaws 3-D storyline"", while entertainment website Flickering Myth posted the story ""Deja Vu: Isn't Jurassic World just Deep Blue Sea with dinosaurs?"", which outlined plot and character similarities between the two films. Pop culture website The Complex stated Jurassic World is ""basically going to be the big budget Deep Blue Sea re-imagining that we all deserve. Scientists, driven by a cold near-heartless leader, tinkering with already smart animals. The beast whisperer who warns against fucking with nature. It's like watching Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane flirt all over again.""

Filmed in Rio de Janeiro in December 2019, Just Another Christmas was released on December 3, 2020, on Netflix.","Section: Plot (1):
In 2010, a man named Jorge, who was born on Christmas and hates celebrating his birthday, awakens on Christmas Eve to prepare for the upcoming holiday. After rudely talking about his grandfather-in-law, Vô Nhanhão, who has not talked for many years, Jorge is told by Nhanhão that he will learn the true meaning of Christmas. That same night, Jorge is told by his wife Laura to dress up as Santa and to get on the roof to appear as the jolly old man. By accident, Jorge falls off the roof and knocks himself unconscious.
In 2011, a confused Jorge awakens on Christmas Eve, with a new car, a recently-received promotion, and a secret smoking addiction, but with no memories of the past year. Like the year before, Jorge encounters some of the same events, such as Leo asking him for money, Luana inviting her new boyfriend, and Tio Victor being offended at the dinner table and running away with the dinner turkey.
Once again, Jorge wakes up on Christmas Eve, this time in 2012, with no memories of the year prior. To not have to spend another Christmas Eve with the family, Jorge decides to take sleeping pills when he awakens each year. In 2021, Jorge is stopped by Laura from taking the pills, and he is forced to confront the changes in his life. Throughout the day, Jorge learns that he had two bypass surgeries due to his smoking addiction and that he has an on-going affair with Márcia, his secretary at work.
In 2022, Jorge awakens to find out that he has divorced Laura and moved in with Márcia, also finding a pre-recorded video, from the Jorge who lives through the year, telling him to enjoy his new life.

In the following years, Jorge learns that he has become a grandfather, that his brother-in-law, Leo, has become rich, and that his daughter has developed terminal breast cancer. To spend time with his daughter, the pair watch her favorite movie, Shrek the Halls, which she had begged him to watch back in 2010. The next year, Jorge learns that his daughter has passed away.
That same day, Jorge is told by Nhanhão to simply ""make a wish."" After Laura brings out his birthday cake, and Jorge makes a wish, Jorge awakens on Christmas Eve in 2010, determined to make better life choices in his second try on life (also saving a breast cancer leaflet for his daughter).

",,"The most ambitious holiday movie this year isn’t this Hallmark one or that animated one, a gay romance or a kiddie farce.

It’s “Just Another Christmas” and it comes from Brazil, where it’s titled “Tudo Bem No Natal Que Vem.”

Yes, it’s a comedy and the laughs are a bit broad — pratfalls, cakes in the face, mustache gags. And as is often the case, the giggles are too few in number.

But consider the themes and movies this mash-up is mashing up. There’s a little “It’s a Wonderful Life” and a lot of “Groundhog Day,” with just a hint of “Memento” without the violence and with (somewhat) less profanity.

Jorge (Leandro Hassum) is a middle class galoot who’s doing all right by himself, and by his family. Every year, all his wife’s relatives — and a couple of his — gather for Christmas dinner. Every year, he struggles to remember what his kids want, what wife Laura (Elisa Pinheiro) expects him to brave the mob scene at the stores to buy.

And he hates Christmas. He tolerates it for the sake of others, but just barely. Why? He’s told us in the opening narration.

He was born on Christmas Day. And “Everybody born on Christmas Day knows, we never get a decent birthday party,” as he notes (in Portuguese, with English subtitles — or if you choose, dubbed into English, German, etc.). For whatever reason, that blunts the “magic” of the day and leaves one an excuse to sour on it. When you hit your late teens, a lot of people “stop celebrating it.”

But when you get married and have kids, you have to go with the flow and at least pretend to enjoy it. And yes, this is totally a thing for many of us born on the same day as Jesus and Jimmy Buffett.

But on a typically raucous and dysfunctional Christmas eve, his brother (Rodrigo Fagundes) taps him for another cash “loan,” Uncle Victor’s insulted Laura’s sister for her “whorelike” cleavage and taken offense at being called a “senile jerk” and is taking the turkey he brought and leaving in a huff — again — and Jorge irks his mother-in-law — again.

Then Jorge suits up as Santa and takes a fall from the roof. He’s had enough of pretending. These people, young and old, are exhausting and it’s just not worth it.

That’s when catatonic grandpa Nhanhão (Levi Ferreira) speaks so that only Jorge will hear.

“You will find out what Christmas is good for,” he intones.

Sounds like a “curse?” That’s what Jorge figures, too, when he wakes up the next day, and it’s Christmas all over again. Only a whole year has passed. And he missed all of it.

That’s the gimmick here. Jorge, who hates Christmas, experiences nothing but a succession of Christmases. It’s “schizophrenia” or “amnesia” or what have you, but he even misses the brain scans and various diagnoses he’s gotten over the course of the year.

And what he misses multiplies each and every year, jumping ahead occasionally by several years at once, when he wakes up and discovers a kid who’s gotten taller, a mustache he can’t believe he’s grown or the open heart surgery scar from his “latest” bypass.

His family life is passing him by, the connection with them loosens and tears over his dismissal of the holiday. He misses funerals, doesn’t remember when the kids start dating, and who they’re dating now. Heck, there’s even a mistress (Danielle Winits) he doesn’t realize he’s decided he prefers to all this togetherness.As somebody who figures a Christmas movie should be about something, and something to say about the holidays and family, etc., I have to say “Just Another Christmas” passes the test at least as well as “Happiest Season,” something “Jingle Jangle” failed completely.

Hassum is a pleasantly amusing lead, if entirely too prone to mugging. His reactions to his dilemma and what he’s supposed to learn from it are spot on. His “journey” takes him from “Whatever” to “Why me?” to “Why did you wake me up this year?” Jorge may not be a George Bailey in terms of jerking tears at the sentiment expressed. But he’s a step above Fred Claus and at least on a par with Tim Allen trapped in “The Santa Clause.”

The pacing is a bit pedestrian, even for an imitation “Groundhog Day” or (closer) “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The slapstick is “meh” and too many of the laugh lines are a blurt of profanity when you half-expect it.

And of all the Brazilian films I’ve seen over the years, “Just Another Christmas” is the least Brazilian — from the decor and “traditions” to many of the items on the Christmas meal menu. This picture has been totally Americanizado.

It’d be a candidate for a Hollywood or North American Netflix remake. But all they’d be changing was the actors and the language spoken. I wouldn’t mind the same crew taking another crack at this clever story, one with about twice as many jokes and sight gags to give it its due. ",6.7,3502,"Comedy,Drama",Positive,0.95

",,,,"It's a normal school day, just before the Christmas holidays, and everyone is excited about the upcoming play. A child, intent on playing with others in the schoolyard, throws a stone breaking a window and slightly injuring the janitor. It is a Muslim child and the incident will give rise to a debate, full of twists, which will see the principal, the teacher, the janitor and his wife as protagonists and of course the child's mother together with his mother-in-law.
Put together Rolando Ravello (one of the writers of Perfect Strangers) and Stefano Massini (writer of 7 minutes) and you have the Italian Carnage with the right dose of fun, nastiness and opportunities for reflection.

Because starting from a cast in which each role is assigned with great attention and sensitivity towards the potential of the performers (including an unprecedented Kasja Smutniak in a Mussulman / indignant version) everything works perfectly.

Leaving aside some venial flaws (the improper use of rabbit glue for example), the mechanism that is set in motion by the stone of the little Samir proceeds without holds barred but following a progression that we could find in the everyday life of our lives. Because everyone is convinced that they are on the side of reason and there are neither social status nor ideologies that hold. If the headmaster tries to get by by inventing a multicultural Christmas play (in which St. Augustine dominates and in which the roles of animals are assigned ad hoc) the vegan / esoteric teacher hides behind the smile and openness to the world rancors that have never really subsided. . Perhaps the only one without sin and therefore able to throw the first stone is Samir because even the biting and sarcastic grandmother and the annoyed parent have not only reasons to adduce.

Ravello and Massini in less than 90 minutes elaborate an x-ray of our country in which laughter mixes with despair because objectivity no longer seems to exist and everything is subjected to interpretation. So if the mother can try to justify the child's gesture by citing various reasons that are not all shared, the headmaster climbs on the mirrors (and on the desk) to 'prove' that playing the ox in the crib is a leading role. Nobody is saved in this school / Italy where prejudice reigns supreme and where resentment seems to be the only glue (other than rabbit glue!) That unites everyone in an unstoppable free fall into social decay. ",5.4,186, Comedy,Positive,0.781

After dropping off their 22-year-old daughter Maddie to her senior year at Decatur University in Atlanta, Dan tells Deanna that he wants a divorce because he has fallen in love with another woman, realtor Marcie. Heartbroken, Deanna visits her parents Mike and Sandy to tell them what happened, with Mike furiously denouncing Dan for making Deanna drop out of college in her final year because she was pregnant, as well as his overbearing ways during their marriage.
Deanna visits Maddie to tell the news and about her plans to enroll at Decatur University to finish her degree in Archaeology. Maddie is doubtful, but supportive. She introduces Deanna to her sorority friends Amanda, neurotic Debbie, and Helen. Deanna later meets her agoraphobic and chronically depressed roommate Leonor. On the first day of school, she meets demeaning girls Jennifer and Trina, who mock Deanna's age.
Deanna, supported by good friend Christine, joins Dan, supported by Marcie, at a mediation session to prepare their divorce papers. Marcie intends to sell their house without Deanna's approval.
Maddie and her friends take Deanna to a frat party, where she meets a student named Jack, a friend of Maddie's boyfriend, Tyler. The next morning mother and daughter catch each other leaving the bedrooms of their respective guys. Jack has truly fallen for Deanna, and they have sex again in the stacks at the library.
Another night, they attend an 80's-themed party where Deanna has a dance-off with Jennifer, resulting in earning the respect of her schoolmates. She has become both “one of the girls” but also a trusted mentor to Maddie's sorority sisters, who make her an honorary sister. Deanna is also doing great in her classes, until she has a midterm exam that requires an oral presentation. Her stage fright causes her to collapse part way through.
While Deanna is at a restaurant with Christine and Frank (her husband), and another couple (Bill and Amy) from their group of friends, Dan and Marcie unexpectedly show up, declaring they are getting married. Jack turns out to be Marcie's son, and, knowing about Deanna sleeping with Jack, Marcie walks out in disgust.
While Maddie attends Dan and Marcie's wedding, Deanna and her student friends unknowingly get high from chocolate bark laced with marijuana, and they head to the reception, where they start wrecking the wedding hall. Dan, Marcie and Maddie find them and Marcie tells Deanna she is cut off financially from Dan.
Deanna tries to make amends with Maddie, and tells her that she is leaving college since she has no means of paying the rest of her tuition. The girls decide to throw a party to raise the money. No one shows up as they are at a Christina Aguilera concert, so Helen posts a Twitter message claiming Aguilera will be at the party after her show. Christine and Frank attend, along with Mike and Sandy. Mike offers to give Deanna a 401K check to pay her tuition, but Deanna refuses. The party is soon filled with people expecting Aguilera, when a suspicious Jennifer confronts Helen, telling her that if Aguilera doesn't show up in three seconds, Jennifer will put Helen in another coma. The two girls engage in a serious fist fight until Deanna intervenes, telling them that girls should support each other and behave like friends. Suddenly, Aguilera (who turns out to be Leonor's cousin) arrives, and puts on a show with Deanna and the girls to an excited crowd.
Deanna still needs to complete her presentation in class. She is nervous until Maddie, Helen, Amanda, Debbie and all the sorority sisters show up to support her, and this time, Deanna manages to give the presentation with ease. At the end of the year, Deanna and Maddie graduate together, with all their friends and family there to support them. Maddie encourages Deanna to throw her cap in the air. She does so, and it hits Dan in the face.

Set during the war in Afghanistan, it dramatizes the unsuccessful United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission Operation Red Wings, during which a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team was given the task of tracking down the Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. The film was written and directed by Peter Berg and stars Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana.
Upon first learning of the book in 2007, Berg arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss adapting the book to film. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights in August 2007, after bidding against other major studios. In re-enacting events, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, as well as autopsy and incident reports related to the mission. After directing Battleship (2012) for Universal, Berg resumed working on Lone Survivor. Principal photography began in October 2012 and concluded in November, after 42 days. Filming took place on location in New Mexico, using digital cinematography. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors, while multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces aided the production. Two companies, Industrial Light & Magic and Image Engine, created the visual effects.
Lone Survivor opened in limited release in the United States on December 25, 2013, before opening across North America on January 10, 2014. It received generally positive reviews; some critics praised Berg's direction, as well as the acting, story, visuals and battle sequences, while others derided the film for focusing more on its action scenes than on characterization. It grossed over $154 million, of which $125 million was from North America. It was chosen by National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2013, and received two Oscar nominations for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.","Section: Plot (1):
In 2005, Afghanistan, Taliban leader Ahmad Shah is responsible for killing over twenty United States Marines, as well as villagers and refugees who were aiding American forces. In response to these killings, a United States Navy SEALs unit is ordered to conduct a counter-insurgent mission to capture Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is given the task of locating Shah. The four SEALs include team leader Michael Murphy, Marksmen and medic Marcus Luttrell, Matthew Axelson and communications specialist Danny Dietz.
The team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains where they begin to encounter communications problems. Unfortunately, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by local goat herders, whom the SEALs detain. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert the Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, the team chooses to release them and abort the mission. On their way up the mountain, they are attacked by Taliban forces. Although the SEALs kill several Taliban gunmen, they are heavily outnumbered and at a disadvantage. The men also sustain various wounds during the firefight, which are exacerbated when they jump off the edge of a ridge and into a large ravine.
Despite their injuries, the SEALs make a defensive retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to lead the escape while Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is shot again; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall off the cliff. A fatally wounded Dietz remains at the top of the cliff and dies. Murphy attempts to climb back up the cliff to get a phone signal to call for support via satellite phone with Axelson and Luttrell providing cover fire. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert his unit of his team's predicament and request assistance before he is killed.
In response to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force made up of fellow SEALs boards Chinook helicopters and heads toward the location without gunship escort. When they arrive, the Taliban shoot down one of the helicopters, killing all eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators aboard, including Commander Kristensen, while the second helicopter is forced back. Luttrell and Axelson are left to fend for themselves again. Axelson is killed while attacking several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact throws him to the bottom of a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban and eventually escape.
Luttrell stumbles upon a small body of water where a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, discovers him. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a man to the nearest American base to alert them to Luttrell's location. Taliban fighters arrive at the village to execute Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his villagers are initially able to fend off the attackers but are nearly overrun before American forces arrive and defeat the advancing Taliban. After thanking the villagers who had saved him, Luttrell is evacuated. He almost succumbs to his injuries but is revived in time.
Images of the real Luttrell, Gulab and the fallen service members killed during the mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an epilogue reveals that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali.

Mark Wahlberg as Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell: The hospital corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance and surveillance team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg was the first actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were left out in the book. ""The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing"", he explained. ""I wanted to come at it from this perspective."" Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, ""Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they're not around to speak for themselves."" Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: ""This is the best working experience I've ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn't stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie.""
Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy: A lieutenant who serves as the team leader and spotter of SEAL Team 10. Lone Survivor is Kitsch's second feature film collaboration with Berg after Battleship (2012). Kitsch said, ""Murph's actions speak louder than anything he's ever said, and they should. I think he was that type of leader who just loved his guys, and getting the nod to play this guy was something special."" Prior to production of the film, Kitsch prepared for the role by performing high-intensity workouts with body armor and long runs with a 40-lb weighted vest.
Emile Hirsch as Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz: SEAL Team 10's communications specialist and spotter. Hirsch was approached by Berg in 2009, and physically prepared for the role by attending a 90-minute weight program for nearly four months. ""I wanted a challenge, so I started to train and work out on my own"", he said. ""I genuinely didn't know what was going to happen. Months went by and it was to the point where I was passing on other movies, but I didn't have this job. I was willing to do anything. I ended up training six days a week, four to five hours a day.""
Ben Foster as Petty Officer Second Class Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson: SEAL Team 10's sniper. Wahlberg recommended Foster to Berg, as they had previously collaborated on Contraband (2012). Prior to filming, Foster met with the fallen serviceman's family and friends to understand the person he would be portraying. ""It was such a rich opportunity to listen to the Axelsons talk about their son. Their generosity and inclusiveness with me was so touching and open. They love to talk about their boy because they love him; so we, in turn, love him. We can't bring him back, but what we can do is aim, every day, to do the best that we can to honor him.""
Eric Bana as Lieutenant Commander Erik S. Kristensen: SEAL Team 10's quick-reaction force (QRF) lieutenant commander. Bana had read the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing to appear in the film, regardless of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, ""There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [Berg] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I wanted to be a part of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time."" Bana did not physically prepare for the role. ""My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved"", he explained. ""It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely. There's no purpose in me going out and firing an M4 in this case.""Ali Suliman, who previously collaborated with Berg on the 2007 film The Kingdom, plays Mohammad Gulab, an Afghan villager; Alexander Ludwig plays Navy SEAL Machinist's Mate Shane Patton. Marcus Luttrell appears in the film in an uncredited role. He first appears as a SEAL teammate who lightheartedly hazes Patton, then during a briefing scene where he is seen shaking his head when the Rules of Engagement are being explained, and later as one of the servicemen who perishes when a CH-47 Chinook is shot down. Luttrell said of the latter scene, ""I was on the other side of the mountain when those guys came to help me, so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me.""The cast is rounded out by Yousuf Azami as Ahmad Shah, a Taliban leader; Sammy Sheik as Taraq, a field commander of the Taliban group; Rich Ting as SO2 James Suh; Dan Bilzerian as Senior Chief Special Operator (SOCS) Daniel Healy; Jerry Ferrara as United States Marine Corps Sgt Hasslert; Scott Elrod as Peter Musselman; Rohan Chand as Gulab's son; and Corey Large as US Navy SEAL Captain Kenney. Zarin Mohammad Rahimi, who acted as a technical advisor during production, appears as an elderly shepherd who discovers the four-man SEAL team during the mission; Nicholas Patel and Daniel Arroyo play the goat herders who assist the shepherd.

Following publication of Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson's nonfiction book Lone Survivor (2007), producer Barry Spikings met Luttrell's attorney Alan Schwartz, who was interested in making a film adaptation. Schwartz suggested that Spikings' son-in-law Akiva Goldsman write the screenplay. Goldsman did not believe he was the right screenwriter for the project, and suggested that Peter Berg write and direct the film. Spikings and Goldsman passed the book on to Berg's producing partner Sarah Aubrey. Berg first learned of the book while filming Hancock, and after he and Aubrey read it, they arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss a film adaptation. Luttrell also viewed a rough cut of Berg's then-upcoming film The Kingdom (2007), and was impressed by his direction. ""[Berg] caught me with his attention to detail"", he said, ""and how he portrayed the enemy in the film.""The film rights to the book had become the subject of a bidding war among a host of established studios, including Warner Bros., Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, and Universal Pictures. Universal secured the rights in August 2007, for more than $2 million. The studio had also acquired the United States distribution rights as part of a negative pickup deal with the film's producers. Berg then chose to direct Battleship (2012) for Universal before resuming production on Lone Survivor.

When Mark Wahlberg read the script and expressed an interest in portraying Luttrell, he and his manager Stephen Levinson pitched the concept to producer Randall Emmett, the co-founder of Emmett/Furla Films, during the 2012 filming of 2 Guns. After reading the script, Emmett traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with Berg and Aubrey to discuss the film's production. After Universal secured the rights to distribute Lone Survivor in the United States, United Kingdom and Italy, executive producer Mark Damon's independent film company Foresight Unlimited took Berg and Emmett to the 2012 Cannes Film Festival to secure worldwide pre-sales. The film attracted $30 million in worldwide pre-sales to distributors in 40 international markets.Lone Survivor had an estimated budget of $40 million. Three production companies – Emmett/Furla Films, Herrick Entertainment, and Envision Entertainment – collaborated to finance the film. In addition, as part of the negative pickup deal with Universal, the film's producers—Berg, Aubrey, Spikings, Goldsman, Emmett, Wahlberg, Levinson, Norton Herrick, and Vitaly Grigoriants—contributed at least $1 million each to finance production costs.  To avoid further costs, Berg chose to work for a minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules, $17,000 a week. He also convinced several cast and crew members to lower their asking prices.

Section: Casting (2):
Berg had discussed the project with Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster years earlier. Universal held an open casting call in Los Angeles, aiding in the filmmakers' search for supporting actors, extras, photo doubles, and stand-ins. In August 2012, it was announced that Alexander Ludwig and Eric Bana had joined the cast.Although Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster had physically trained for their roles prior to filming, Luttrell organized a three-week training regimen at a bootcamp in New Mexico, where the actors were trained by elite military personnel in weapons,  military communications, and tactics. Military advisor Mark Semos trained the four actors in live-firing exercises so they could feel the physical impact of firing military rifles. They also practiced ""shoot move cover"" drills to improve their muscle memory and enable them to react convincingly as Navy SEALs during filming.

Section: Writing (2):
While the book chronicles Luttrell's 1999 enlistment and training, as well as his 2005 deployment to Afghanistan, Berg decided that the film adaptation would focus mainly on the events of the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, as well as the bonding and camaraderie of Luttrell and his fallen teammates. Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. ""My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed"", he said. ""I went to New York and met the Murphys. I went to Colorado and met the Dietzes, and I went to Northern California and met the Axelsons. After spending time with them, you realize that these kids were the best and the brightest; they were the stars of the families. The grief and the wounds are still very raw. You would have to be inhuman to not feel the responsibility when that kind of grief gets shared with you."" Berg also expressed that he was motivated by the families to make the story as realistic as possible; his goal was ""to put [the viewer] into the experience of what these guys went through. And it was obviously a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience"".To provide authenticity, Luttrell moved into Berg's home for one month while Berg was writing the script. He acted as a consultant, detailing to Berg his eyewitness account of the events that unfolded during Operation Red Wings. Berg later embedded with a Navy SEAL team—becoming the first civilian to do so—and lived with them for a month in Iraq while he continued writing the screenplay. In re-enacting the injuries and deaths of the fallen Navy SEAL servicemen, Berg relied on Luttrell's eyewitness accounts from the book, as well as autopsy reports of the deceased and after-action reports. The United States Navy provided incident reports related to the mission, as well as archival military training footage, which is shown during the film's opening credits sequence. Still photographs shown during the opening credits sequence were taken from Richard D. Schoenberg's war photography book The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday: Making Navy SEALs. During filming, there were some dialogue changes in comparison to Berg's script, as the filmmaker occasionally encouraged the actors to improvise their lines.

Section: Principal photography (3):
Principal photography was scheduled to start on September 15, 2012, but did not commence until October of that year. The film was shot on location in New Mexico. The production received a 25% tax credit for shooting in the state. Berg was granted creative autonomy, as Universal did not fully oversee the film's production. With Lone Survivor, Berg continued his trademark of having war veterans as part of his film crew. Luttrell, along with several other Navy SEAL veterans, acted as technical advisors during the production. In addition, senior military advisor Harry Humphries, a former Navy SEAL who had worked with Berg on Hancock and The Kingdom, served as an associate producer.Filming first took place at the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Santa Fe National Forest. Eight days were spent on mountains ranging from 11,000 to 12,000 feet (3,400–3,700 m). In recreating the Hindu Kush mountain range that stretches between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the film crew shot at 10 separate locations in the national forest. Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was given the task of depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunts, nor did he have the performers use wires or dummies; He instructed them to fall 15 to 20 feet (4.6–6.1 m) off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control.Production moved to Chilili, New Mexico for two weeks of filming. The location's wooded areas were used to film several battle scenes, and the art department built sets to create an Afghan village occupied by Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami) and his Taliban insurgents, as well as a Pashtun village where Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) is rescued. Filming then moved to Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which doubled for scenes set in Bagram Airfield, a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. The production then moved to soundstages at I-25 Studios in Albuquerque. The filmmakers occupied two 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) stages in the facility for interior scenes and bluescreen work. The art department built the character Gulab's house, as well as interiors for Bagram Airfield's patrol base Camp Ouellette. The bluescreen work involved scenes depicting a CH-47 Chinook in a gimbal, and a 4-foot scale model of a Hindu Kush mountain cliff built by the art department team in Los Angeles. Principal photography concluded in November 2012, after 42 days of filming.

Section: Cinematography (3):
Lone Survivor was director of photography Tobias Schliessler's fifth collaboration with Berg, as well as Berg's first film to be shot with digital cinematography. Schliessler intended to shoot the film with Arri Alexa cameras, but instead used Red Epic digital cameras with Fujinon and Angénieux lenses. He chose the Red Epic camera ""due to its compact size and lightweight body.""For the film's visual style, Schliessler was influenced by British-American photojournalist Tim Hetherington's war photography book Infidel, which details a single U.S. platoon assigned to an outpost in the Korengal Valley during the war in Afghanistan. Prior to filming, Schleissler and Berg shot test footage with the digital cameras and brought it to digital colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld at post-production facility Company 3 for color grading.The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky terrain and steep inclines proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted in much of the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. ""The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding"", Schleissler explained. ""All our equipment had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which meant we had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum ... No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort that made us a close film family.""Digital cinema post-production facility DeLuxe supplied the production with a 40-foot trailer, known as the EC3 (a joint venture between Company 3 and EFILM).  The equipment enabled Schleissler to oversee every shot of the film in the EC3 trailer. He also collaborated with colorist Adrian Delude in changing the exposure for all cameras used which, according to Schliessler, ""would have been more difficult when shooting on film."" Company 3 carried out the digital intermediate.

Section: Design and effects (3):
To produce the many injuries received by the four-man SEAL team, the filmmakers recruited KNB Effects team Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger. To aid Nicotero and Berger in recreating the injuries of the fallen servicemen, Berg provided autopsy reports of the deceased. Special effects supervisor Bruno van Zeebroeck created RPG explosions and bullet hits for the battle sequences that occur in the roads around Gulab's home. Multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces supplied the production with military vehicles. The United States Air Force provided two Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawks from Kirtland Air Force Base, both of which were manned by military personnel and used to depict a combat search and rescue. The United States Army provided the production with two MH-47 Chinooks and two Boeing AH-64 Apaches from Fort Hood, Texas. The United States Marine Corps provided thirty Marine Corps reservists for scenes set in Bagram Airfield and Jalalabad. According to The Economist, Beretta paid the production company $250,000 to use their guns in the film in place of the Sig Sauer p226 and Kimber 1911s weapons actually used by SEAL teams.

Section: Costume design (3):
Costume designer Amy Stofsky ensured that the military wardrobe seen in the film reflected the 2005 time period. According to Stofsky, what the fallen servicemen wore back then is no longer current issue, as the United States Armed Forces stopped manufacturing the uniforms in 2006. While researching the time period, Stofsky met with the fallen servicemen's families, as well as Navy SEAL teammates. Stofsky and the wardrobe department collaborated with the Hollywood-based costume facility Western Costume to find the right fabric for the military uniforms. She and her team manufactured uniforms for the film's lead actors, extras, stunt and photo doubles, and military personnel who were also acting as extras. Stofksy noted that a total of ""36 cookie cutter uniforms"" were produced for Wahlberg.In designing the costumes for the Pashtun people and Taliban forces, Stofsky aimed to create a visual distinction between the villagers and Taliban fighters. ""Luttrell survived because of the age-old tradition of the Pashtun culture in providing hospitality and safety to those that enter their home"", she explained. ""We dyed the Taliban's costumes black, charcoal, wine, and indigo and kept the villagers light. Their humanity prevails. This is what we hoped to get across."" Stofsky utilized a North Hollywood-based Afghan vendor, Moe Noorzai, for traditional Afghan clothing including vests, pants, dresses and Kashmir scarves. Stofsky also had a New Mexico-based tailor produce all of the turbans featured in the film. Zarin Mohammad Rahimi, an Afghan refugee who fled to the United States to avoid the Taliban, and his sons, Muhammad Nawroz Rahimi and Nawaz Rahimi, were hired to act as technical advisors during production. The Rahimis collaborated with Stofsky, as well as the wardrobe and casting departments, to help them understand the language, customs and fighting methods of the Pashtun villagers and Taliban fighters. The eldest Rahimi also appears in the film as an elderly shepherd.

Section: Editing (3):
Editing and post-production work took roughly seven months to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker spent six months editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. ""I like to blast through the footage to keep up with the camera. This way I can let [Berg] know if any extra coverage is needed"", he explained. ""Often I'll get word to the 1st [assistant director] and he'll sneak in extra shots if the schedule permits. Although I will have a first assembly when the production wraps, Peter will never sit though a complete viewing of that. He works in a very linear manner, so as we start to view a scene, if there's something that bothers him, we'll stop and address it.""
The first cut of the film was two-and-a-half hours long. Parker then cut the film down to two hours when he realized there was a way to further trim the film. ""There were a number of scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we wanted to let the mission briefing scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. We realized that an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so intercutting these scenes helped keep the audience engaged.""Sound editing and mixing work took place at Todd Soundelux. Supervising sound editor Wylie Stateman recorded on-location sound during filming, placing microphones on the actors' backpacks and clothing ""so [the viewers] would hear explosions and bullets going by as though [they] were with these guys as they were being attacked."" In creating sound effects for the environment of each scene, Stateman relied on foley design, rather than traditional sound effects.

Section: Visual effects (3):
The two visual effects companies for the film were Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Image Engine, with overall supervision by Grady Cofer and Jesper Kjölsrud, respectively. In total, the film has over 400 visual effects shots. ILM was responsible only for creating a helicopter crash sequence in the film. Berg requested that the sequence be done by ILM, who had also worked on his previous film Battleship. Image Engine's effects work consisted mainly of set extensions and location enhancements; scenes were supplemented with computer-generated mountains, buildings and backgrounds, as well as muzzle flashes for firearms.

Section: Music (2):
The film's score was composed by Steve Jablonsky and American post-rock band Explosions in the Sky. Jablonsky said of the collaboration, ""It was great. I didn't work directly with them because they're in Austin, Texas and I'm in L.A. I spoke to them on the phone and I think sixty, sixty‑five percent of the scores is them. We ended up doing our own things. We tried to not have two totally different sounding scores.""Berg said, ""[Jablonsky] did the last reel; the band Explosions in the Sky did pretty much did everything else. They have an emotional, tender quality to their music, even when it gets aggressive. I didn't want the score to be overly aggressive, I wanted it to be haunting and emotional. Steve Jablonsky came in at the end to do something more traditional, but when Steve does ""traditional"", it's not the usual strings. He created a wonderful sound at the very end."" The motion picture soundtrack album was released on December 17, 2013 by record label Metropolis Movie Music.

Lone Survivor received ""largely positive reviews"" from film critics, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Los Angeles Times reported the critics' consensus was that ""the film succeeds in bringing the mission to life, although it avoids probing the deeper issues at hand."" Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 224 reviews, and gave the film an approval rating of 75%, with an average score of 6.57/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""A true account of military courage and survival, Lone Survivor wields enough visceral power to mitigate its heavy-handed jingoism."" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, assigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 44 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating to be ""mixed or average reviews"". CinemaScore polls conducted during Lone Survivor's opening weekend of wide release reported that male and female audiences gave the film a rare ""A+"" (on an A+ to F scale), with exit polls showing that 57% of the audience was male, while 57% was at least 30 years of age or older.Justin Chang, writing for Variety magazine, gave the film a positive review and called it ""the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, as well as a prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization."" Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, ""The film never makes a grand statement about whether or not the war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we're used to in movies like this, but then he pulls out the rug, reminding us that the cavalry doesn't always miraculously show up in time to save the day."" Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being ""rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line,"" while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor ""brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving."" Leonard Maltin described the film as ""visceral"", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film ""is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded."" Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: ""The production and costume designers have paid a great deal of attention to the details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude.""Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for focusing more on its action scenes than on characterization. In his review for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, ""This is the sort of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency."" Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, ""The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were.""One of the film's strongest detractors was Time Out magazine's Keith Uhlich, who called the film ""war porn of the highest order"". Geoff Pevere wrote in his review for The Globe and Mail, ""The sensation of being pinned down and shot apart is so harrowingly conveyed ... that one almost forgives the movie's failure to be quite as persuasive in almost every other respect."" While praising the film for its visuals and sound effects, as well as Berg's atmospheric direction, Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave Lone Survivor a mixed review. Smith concluded his review by describing it as ""a movie about an irrelevant skirmish that ended in near-total catastrophe, during a war we are not winning."" Film critic Steven Boone, writing for Roger Ebert's website, compared the film's violence to that of Mel Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ: ""What's in between amounts to The Passion of the Christ for U.S. servicemen: a bloody historic episode recounted mainly in images of hardy young men being ripped apart, at screeching volume. Though Berg's source material isn't the New Testament, he often handles Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell's account ... with the thunderous reverence Mel Gibson brought to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.""

On July 2, 1927, Ma Rainey is a highly regarded blues singer who has recently been contracted by white producers. A recording session for songs by Ma  is scheduled by her manager Irvin to take place at Paramount recording studios in Chicago. Seasoned Georgia Jazz Band members Toledo, Cutler, and Slow Drag arrive on time without Ma, frustrating her producer Mel Sturdyvant. They are soon joined by Levee Green, the band's overconfident trumpeter who has shown Sturdyvant his original compositions in the hopes of breaking away from Ma and getting his own record deal. The rest of the band disapproves of this.
Ma arrives an hour late with her girlfriend Dussie Mae and her nephew Sylvester. Ma immediately forces Sturdyvant to have the opening words of the album be spoken by Sylvester, who has a blocking stutter. As a result, the group has to do multiple takes of the song “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,"" much to the band's frustration.
Ma interrupts the session after Irvin fails to bring her Coca-Cola, forcing Slow Drag and Sylvester to get her one. Ma complains to Cutler that her white bosses do not care for her as a person in part because of her race, and he agrees; she tells him that she does not want to be bossed around for her own art and should be allowed to do what she pleases. Meanwhile, Levee and Dussie Mae have sex in the practice room.
The group finally manages to go through the first track after multiple takes, but discover an equipment failure has caused it not to be recorded. The band blames Levee, who they think tripped over a wire while eyeing Dussie. Their argument leads to the religious Cutler talking about how a preacher he once knew was forced to dance for some white men who tore up his Bible while waiting for his train. Levee brushes off the story, saying that if there was a God, He would care for Black people, which He never has. Cutler attacks Levee in anger, leading Levee to briefly brandish a knife in retaliation.
The group finally finishes recording, but Ma fires Levee soon afterwards, believing his ambition to be detrimental to the band. Levee then meets with Sturdyvant about his original songs, but discovers that he will only purchase the songs, insisting that there is no market for the songs. Levee suffers a mental breakdown, and, after Toledo accidentally steps on his new shoes, Levee fatally stabs him in the back with the knife. Cutler and Slow Drag leave in horror as a regretful Levee cradles Toledo's corpse. Later, Sturdyvant records Levee's songs with a band consisting entirely of white men (supposedly Paul Whiteman's orchestra).

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Framed by a pair of powerhouse performances, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom pays affectionate tribute to a blues legend — and Black culture at large."" According to Metacritic, which compiled 46 reviews and calculated a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, the film received ""universal acclaim"".Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang said: ""Boseman, evincing the same integrity he clung to his entire career, refuses to soft-pedal the destination. He imparts to this seething, shattered man the gift of a broken soul, driven by anger and trauma, and makes him all the more human for it. His final moments of screen time are among his darkest, and also his finest."" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a ""B"" grade and praised Boseman and Davis's performances, saying: ""All of this would be more concerning if Ma Rainey's Black Bottom didn't turn on Wilson's crackling dialogue and a jazzy pace on par with the music. Above all, the movie amounts to a solid resurrection that doesn't muck up the bulk of what made the play click in the first place.""Peter Travers, reviewing the film for ABC News, said: ""Davis plays the real-life Ma Rainey, the Georgia singer dubbed the Mother of the Blues. Boseman invests body and soul into Levee, the hot-headed trumpeter who dares to lock horns with Ma in a shabby Chicago recording studio where they're paid to make music the way the white bosses want it. The time is 1927, but the bristling racial tensions feel as timely as ever.""

60,Malcolm & Marie,United States,Little Lamb Fotokem,Netflix,Zendaya John David Washington,Sam Levinson,106,Sam Levinson,2500000,,"Malcolm & Marie is a 2021 American black-and-white romantic drama film written, produced and directed by Sam Levinson. The film stars Zendaya and John David Washington (who both also produced), and follows a writer-director and his girlfriend, whose relationship is tested on the night of his latest film's premiere when revelations about themselves surface. The project was the first Hollywood feature to be entirely written, financed, and produced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with filming taking place in secret in June and July 2020. American recording artist Kid Cudi also serves as an executive producer on the film.
Malcolm & Marie was released in a limited release on January 29, 2021, before being released digitally on February 5, 2021, by Netflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Zendaya and Washington's performances and chemistry, and Levinson's direction, but criticized his screenplay. For her performance, Zendaya was nominated for Best Actress at the 26th Critics' Choice Awards.","Section: Plot (1):
Writer-director Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington) returns home from his film premiere with his girlfriend Marie Jones (Zendaya). Malcolm eagerly anticipates the critical reviews following the emotional audience response from the screening. When he notices Marie looking displeased, he urges her to tell him what is bothering her. Initially reluctant to start a fight in the middle of the night, she tells him that she is upset that she was not thanked or acknowledged in his speech at the premiere.
Marie believes that she is the basis of his film, a drama about a struggling black female drug addict named Imani, as she herself was a drug addict when they met. Malcolm dismisses her accusations, claiming that the Imani is not based on her and is an amalgamation of different people. Marie insists that he would not have authentically portrayed Imani's struggles with drug abuse and addiction if they were not together. Malcolm believes that Marie is overreacting, claiming that, because she quit acting years ago, she is jealous of the actress who played Imani and that she is projecting her personal problems on him and his film. Marie affirms her position on his lack of acknowledgment and calls his talents ""mediocre"". While Marie is taking a bath, Malcolm describes to her the different women he had relationships with, who inspired the character of Imani, stating that only Imani's feelings of hopelessness were based on Marie.
Later, Malcolm finds and reads the first critic review posted about his film. Despite the review being positive, he rants about the white female critic's political interpretation of his film as he did not intend it to be political. He laments that film critics are focusing too much on his black male identity and projecting politics into their interpretations, rather than judging him for his own merits. Marie playfully belittles his angry reaction to the positive review and his inability to take criticism, before the two appear to be bonding again following their arguments.
Before the two can begin to have sex, Marie provokes him when she asks why he did not cast her as Imani, believing that she would have brought a vulnerability and authenticity to the character that could have made the film better. After they angrily accuse each other of being egotistical, Marie then brings out a knife and acts as if she is still a drug addict. She finally reveals she was acting out a scene as Imani to demonstrate authenticity, scaring but impressing Malcolm over how convincing she is. The two go to their bedroom and argue once more, until Marie lectures him about him taking her for granted and his lack of acknowledgement of how their genuine love for each other inspired the film.
Their arguing finally stops as they go to bed without saying anything to each other, only thanking each other before they sleep. Malcolm wakes up alone in bed in the morning daylight. He finds Marie alone outside and joins her as they look across the distance, leaving the fate of their relationship unknown.

At the time, Sam Levinson and Zendaya were both involved in the HBO show Euphoria, which had stopped production due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the two discussed the possibility and idea of making a feature film project during the pandemic. Levinson pitched several projects to Zendaya, including a psychological thriller they would film at her home. He then began to come up with ""a relationship piece that plays out in real time.""John David Washington joined the project after Levinson read 10 pages of dialogue to Washington over the phone, saying ""I couldn’t believe it. It was beautiful words I heard, and at the same time very disturbing with visceral confrontations.""After receiving approval from the Writers Guild of America, SAG-AFTRA and the Directors Guild of America, the film began principal production from June 17 to July 2. Shooting took place entirely at the Caterpillar House, a private home in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The film followed local COVID-19 safety protocols, including the entire cast and crew being quarantined during shooting, as well as two weeks before and after shooting, daily temperature checks, and increased sanitation measures. The crew included many members of the Euphoria crew, including cinematographer Marcell Rév and production designer Michael Grasley. Both Washington and Zendaya were responsible for doing their own makeup and picking out their own costumes, as there were no makeup artists or costume designer on set. No more than 12 people were allowed on set at a time. The production also had to be kept very confined so that the cast and crew could remain undisturbed during shooting.

Charles Bramesco of Little White Lies criticised the film for being an ""awkward, hideously overacted talkathon"" scoring the film with a 1/5 rating.In a rather positive review, Mike Crowley of You'll Probably Agree called Malcolm & Marie a ""decent quarantine capsule"", concluding that it's ""pretentious in all the right ways"" and scored the film with a 3.5/4 rating. Furthermore, although criticizing the film itself, Gompertz positively reviews ""the impressive acting chops of Washington and Zendaya"". Bill Lowry of CNN Entertainment similarly praised their acting, writing ""pairing Zendaya and John David Washington, the movie -- quickly and stealthily shot during the pandemic -- wins points for ingenuity, then loses them with its shrill tone and the uneven hairpin turns of its writing"".In a response to criticism to the film, Sam Levinson said that some critics focused too much on Malcolm and his speech on film criticism and disregarded the importance of Marie's character and opposing viewpoint. Nathalie Moreira of High on Films wrote ""Sam Levinson’s new feature deconstructs traditional romance stereotypes in favor of a modern love story filled with resentment, disorientation, and unresolved issues.""

","It feels like some lost Italian masterpiece from the 1970s. unearthed from a locked vault after decades of gathering dust and slotted into the middle of a late De Sica/ mid-period Francesco Rosi triple feature. The score borrows bits of classical music, Sixties Euro-pop and Eighties Italo-disco — perfect for a period piece rife with both vintage signifiers and modern anachronisms. All the talk of socialism vs. staunch individualism could have come straight from a beer hall in 1920 or a presidential town hall in 2020. It’s a last-century tale whose preoccupations with ambition, fame, status, literature, the lifestyles of the rich, the politics of the poor, a pilgrim’s progress and his eventual disillusionment are universal and timeless.
Martin Eden, filmmaker Pietro Marcello’s adaptation of Jack London’s 1909 novel, is the sort of movie that restores your faith in an art form — or, at the very least, in the craft of turning a bygone era’s paragraphs on a page into an urgent, pomo mix of sound and vision. Words are, in fact, the weapon of choice for the title character, a working-class sailor who trades his predetermined position in life for something less hand-callousing and in his mind, more intellectually creative. “My force is fearsome as long as I have the power of my words to counter against the world,” says Martin (Luca Marinelli), repeating the opening lines of London’s semi-autobiographical book into a tape recorder; later, he’ll tell a buddy, “I note down new words. I turn them into my friends.” He will write his way out of his social standing, one sentence at a time. First, however, he’ll need wisdom, experience, education, a mentor, a patron. And, naturally, a source of inspiration.That comes accidentally when, one early morning, Martin is awakened on his docked ship by the sound of a gentleman being rousted. The perpetrator is some security-guard brute patrolling the pier. The victim is Arturo Orsini (Giustiniano Alpi), concluding the previous evening’s bender. Martin socks the former in the jaw, and is rewarded by the latter with a visit to the Orsini estate. Arturo comes from a well-to-do-family, offering his protector a peek at the indiscreet charms of the upper crust. This glimpse fuels his class aspirations. A young woman, however, provides the inspiration: Elena (Jessica Cressy), Arturo’s sister. She introduces him to poetry and the pleasure of reading, which will in turn introduce him to a previously inaccessible landscape of ideas. Though their desire is mutual, Martin knows that being a laborer isn’t the key to winning her hand or entry into the household. He will initially become a writer in order to impress her. Soon, the profession reveals itself to be a calling.

“Knowledge is power” goes the maxim, but in Martin Eden, knowledge is also an addiction, and our hero is keen on keeping the monkey on his back extremely well-fed. So Martin devours books, soaks up the lives of others, watches everything carefully via Marinelli’s wide, blue eyes. Then he sweats over verbs and sends stories out to be published. He steadfastly refuses his brother-in-law’s offers for work (to be fair, the man is a boorish cretin) and later, for Orsini-aided opportunities to rise in the ranks of business. Martin is determined to make it on his own, a typewriter his only companion, and the film leans into its portrait-of-an-artist-as-a-young-martyr groove. He takes his knocks. A series of odd jobs and travels off the beaten path fills in the gaps of his lack of formal schooling, while a chance encounter with an elderly hedonistic poet named Brissenden (Carlo Cecchi, embodying decades’ worth of boho decadence) helps radicalize him.It’s around this period that, after endless return-to-sender rejections, Martin finally gets a short story in a magazine. “They’re throwing the dog a bone,” his mentor warns him. More offers follow, as does a sense that both of his dream environments — the workers-of-the-world-unite collectives and the velvetine cocoon of the weary rich — are bankrupt. Cue a raw talent’s rise, which also doubles as his big-picture fall. Be very careful what you wish for.

London’s original creation, which the author shared more than a few things in common with, was a representation of an old-fashioned American bootstrap mentality, combined with an outdoorsman’s ruggedness. (Unlike Martin, London had academic bona fides: He went to the University of California, Berkeley, before dropping out to head into the Klondike during the gold rush.) The young Mr. Eden of Marcello’s movie is a far more complicated character, finding fault in both socialism and its critics while eventually taking his proto-Randian fixation on individualism to some harsh extremes. Still, he retains his sense of square-shouldered, he-man earthiness until the final act, which is as good a segue as any to talk about what Luca Marinelli brings to the role. Recently seen fighting and dying and fighting some more in the immortals-are-go! action movie The Old Guard, the actor has a ’30s matinee-idol profile, a ’50s screen-rebel charisma and a ’70s leading man intensity. You understand why everyone goes gaga over him, but more importantly, you get a very clear sense of Martin’s hunger — for Elena, for literary glory, for a place at the gilded table, for political causes and, ultimately, to be left alone. The phrase “a star-making role” should be retired, yet this 35-year-old performer reminds you why it was coined in the first place. You walk away thinking that no one else could have played Martin with such soulfulness or depth.

It’s the man behind the camera as much as the one in front of it, however, that gives Martin Eden such a bracing sense of vitality. Trained as a painter and cutting his teeth on documentaries, Pietro Marcello treats London’s story with respect but without a stifling, suffocating sense of reverence. Relocating the story from Northern California to Naples, Italy, is the least of his personal touches; he and his cinematographers Alessandro Abate and Francesco Di Giacomo also move their 16mm cameras around (the nostalgia-inducing grain on those images!) like they’re shooting actual events as they happen, weaving in and out of his characters. Tinted snippets of real-life sailors and everyday people occasionally bleed into emulsion-heavy scenes that feel lifted from cinema’s infancy. A few bits from the nation’s neo-realistic period get thrown in for good measure. And, as a bonus, you can add Eden to the rare group of great movies — The 400 Blows, La Dolce Vita, Barton Fink, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Planet of the Apes — that end, as great movies should, on a beach.
As with Marcello’s previous film Lost and Beautiful (2015), which blended commedia dell’arte archetypes into a vérité portrait of a Southern Italian shepherd, there’s an anything-goes vibe that doesn’t somehow detract from his story. (Should you want to check that film out, or dip into the Italian director’s past works, Film at Lincoln Center’s virtual retrospective is going on for a few more days.) This London adaptation feels like a leveling up. We watch a young man go from striving hopeful to a craven figure of note, a creative dynamo to a contemptuous shell of his former self. But we also watch two other artists finding their voices and hitting their strides, and the rush of that feels more sustaining than you could possibly imagine.

It premiered in Los Angeles on September 26, 2016 and was theatrically released in the United States on September 30, 2016, by Relativity Media. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $30 million.","Section: Plot (1):
In March 1997, after Loomis Fargo & Company has been robbed of $18.8 million in Jacksonville by company security guard Philip Noel Johnson, Steve Eugene Chambers (Owen Wilson) and Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig), who are also employees of Loomis, decide to rob the company. They involve Loomis armored car driver David Scott Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis). After some awkward training in preparation for the robbery, the team has David go inside Loomis' vault and load the entire money supply into the company's van. Before he leaves, David takes out three CCTV tapes, but misses one. The next day, David flees to Mexico with $20,000 and takes the cover name ""Michael McKinney"", which is the name of a friend of Steve's. Meanwhile, Steve takes most of the heist, around $17 million.
FBI Special Agent Scanlon (Leslie Jones) and her partner (Jon Daly) take the case, and immediately have David as the prime suspect, but have no idea of Steve's involvement. Steve plans to cut David loose but Kelly thinks it would be wrong to abandon him. In Mexico, David narrowly evades three Interpol agents looking for him, and calls Kelly about what happened. Unfortunately, he inadvertently learns Steve's name from the ID in a wallet that Kelly gave to him. With his cover blown, Steve hires the real, but unstable hitman, Michael McKinney (Jason Sudeikis) to hunt David down. He finds David and attempts to shoot him, but the gun backfires and David escapes. David phones Kelly and learns that Steve is trying to kill him, and that Steve will not send the money for him as expected. David is then knocked unconscious by McKinney. When David regains consciousness, McKinney is about to kill him but reconsiders upon looking at ""McKinney""'s birth certificate, thinking that David was born under the same circumstances; they become friends.
David calls Steve, threatening to surrender himself to Interpol if Steve doesn't wire $6 million into his bank account in two days. Kelly is then attacked by Jandice, who learns her engagement with David, at the mall and escapes. When Steve refuses to wire the money, his two friends kidnap Kelly and he tells David to get a ticket to South America in exchange for her release. At the airport, he meets McKinney, who is returning to the U.S., but as he bids farewell he sees Kelly's name written on his hand and tells McKinney that he knows her. Realizing that he can't bring himself to kill her, they switch tickets just as the three Interpol agents attempt to catch David.
While Steve is hosting a party, the FBI puts a wire on one of the party members in an attempt to record Steve's confession. David sneaks in and rescues Kelly. They escape by stealing Steve's BMW but it crashes as they attempt to drive through the gate. Steve catches and assaults him, until David realizes he is near the FBI van with the agents inside. David tricks Steve into admitting that he was the mastermind of the whole plan, giving the agents enough reason to arrest all of them, including Kelly. David is sentenced to seven years in prison, while Steve served eleven years. About $2 million is still unaccounted for. Upon David's release, he is picked up by McKinney and they drive to visit Kelly.

Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave praise to the film, writing that ""Yes, the comedy is funny—even when it’s not laugh-out-loud funny, it’s sparklingly inventive and charmingly loopy—but, above all, it has the religious intensity and spiritual resonance that marks all of Hess’s other films, and it extends his world of ideas into wild new realms, extends his vision into darker corners of existence than he had formerly contemplated."" He also observed the filmmaking of Hess as ""suggest[ing] a kinship with the transcendental cinema of Robert Bresson and Carl Theodor Dreyer.... his images belong to a similar realm of astonishment, even if his are frankly comedic where theirs are irreconcilably tragic.""

63,Midnight at the Magnolia,Canada, Neshama Entertainment,,,,87,,,,,,,,"The reputation of Jack London’s unrivalled depiction of bad faith has endured in mainland Europe, where it has inspired various adaptations and songs and featured on Le Monde’s 100 greatest books of the 20th century. In Vladimir Nabokov’s Pnin, a character is dismayed when an American bookstore does not have the 1909 novel  in stock: “Strange! The vicissitudes of celebrity! In Russia, I remember, everybody – little children, full-grown people, doctors, advocates – everybody read and re-read him.”

Pietro Marcello’s wildly ambitious new version transports Martin Eden from turn-of-the-century Oakland, California to Naples in the 1920s where – thanks to archive footage and dazzling editing work from Aline Hervé and Fabrizio Federico – the revolutionary socialist Errico Malatesta listens to Eden’s repellently individualistic ideology. The character’s politics and rejection of communism as a “slave morality” differentiates him from his socialist creator. In most other respects, however, the story is autobiographical. Or as London had it: “I was Martin Eden.”

Like London, Eden – unforgettably essayed by the magnetic Luca Marinelli – is a girl-chasing, adventurous, handsome bruiser until he rescues a young nobleman named Arturo (Giustiniano Alpi) from a beating. Arturo invites Eden, more as an object of curiosity than out of gratitude, to his family’s palatial estate. Here, Eden falls for Arturo’s sister Elena (Jessica Cressy) and the bourgeois opulence of her surroundings. He vows to become worthy of her by embarking on a gruelling programme of study, writing and self-improvement.An accomplished autodidact, Eden becomes as infatuated with the social Darwinist writings of Herbert Spencer as he is with Elena. His prolific output as a writer is repeatedly rejected. There is something of Nietzsche’s transvaluation of values in Eden’s betrayal of himself and his class, and director Pietro Marcello does not shy away from such weighty philosophical themes.

Working from a script he co-wrote with Maurizio Braucci, Marcello cleverly captures between-the-wars uncertainty while blurring historical lines with Marco Messina and Sacha Ricci’s electronic score. The tragic romance of the source material is amplified by Alessandro Abate and Francesco Di Giacomo’s gorgeous, textured 16mm photography.

In theme and appearance, Martin Eden straddles such Italian cornerstones as De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves and Bertolucci’s The Conformist. It’s a sweep of cinematic history earned by the film’s aspirations. No film could replicate the tragic weight of London’s work, but this comes awfully close.",5.8,4057,"Comedy,Romance",Negative,0.638

Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses as he doesn't train women, and tells her she's ""too old"" to begin a boxing career. Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Frankie's friend and employee—and the film's narrator—encourages and helps her.
Frankie's prize prospect, ""Big Willie"" Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. Frankie then reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. 
Maggie fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching. Since she has earned a reputation for her KOs, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.
Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mickey Mack but, out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows a Gaelic nickname on her. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.
Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas, Nevada, against the WBA women's welterweight champion, Billie ""The Blue Bear"" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as an unpunished dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic.
In a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive days later after touring Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood, accompanied by an attorney; their only concern is to get Maggie's assets transferred to them. Disgusted, Maggie orders them to leave, threatening to report her mother and sister's welfare frauds if they ever try to contact her again.
Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She then asks a favor of Frankie: to help her die, declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankie's priest, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.
Frankie sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he finally tells Maggie the meaning of her nickname, Mo Chuisle (misspelled in the film as ""mo cuishle""): Irish for ""my darling, and my blood"" (literally, ""my pulse""). He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character.

On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 90% approval rating based on 271 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Clint Eastwood's assured direction - combined with knockout performances from Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman - help Million Dollar Baby to transcend its clichés, and the result is deeply heartfelt and moving."" On Metacritic it has a score of 86 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade ""A"" on scale of A to F.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four stars and stated that ""Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece, pure and simple,"" listing it as the best film of 2004. Michael Medved stated: ""My main objection to Million Dollar Baby always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female Rocky, with barely a hint of the pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer ... to declare that 'no movie in my memory has depressed me more than Million Dollar Baby.'""

In early 2005, the film sparked controversy when some disability rights activists protested the ending. The Disability Rights Education Fund released a statement about the film in February 2005 that included the following: ""Perhaps the most central stereotype fueling disability prejudice is the mistaken assumption inherent in the message of the movie that the quality of life of individuals with disabilities is unquestionably not worth living. This stereotype is contradicted by the personal experience of many thousands of people with significant disabilities in this country and around the world who view our own lives as ordinary and normal. It is further contradicted by plenty of hard data. Research overwhelmingly shows that people with disabilities find satisfaction in our lives to the same degree, or greater, than does the general public."" The Chicago Tribune reported that protests against the film by disability activists occurred in Chicago, Berkeley, and other cities, and that Clint Eastwood had previously lobbied for weakening provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act.Wesley J. Smith in The Weekly Standard also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith said, ""The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker.""Eastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the American dream. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, ""I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 Magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do"". Roger Ebert stated that ""a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. Million Dollar Baby is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact"".Some commentators criticized the fact that the phrase mo chuisle, a term of endearment meaning literally ""my pulse"", and generally ""my darling"", was misspelled in the film as Mo Cuishle, as shown on the back of Maggie's robe. It is translated in the film as ""my darling, my blood"", although an Irish Gaeilge translation site states that it is always translated as ""pulse"", not as ""blood"". The original phrase is short for a chuisle mo chroí, meaning ""O pulse of my heart"". The film has been praised, for renewing interest in the Irish language in the U.S.

65,Mister Felicita,Italy,Cattleya,01 Distribution,,"Alessandro Siani, Fabio Bonifacci",89,Alessandro Siani,,10748185,"Mister Felicità è un film del 2017 diretto da Alessandro Siani e interpretato dallo stesso regista con Diego Abatantuono e Carla Signoris.
",,,,"The authorial path of Alessandro Siani continues. In his third film as director, co-writer and performer, the Neapolitan comedian keeps intact the formula of the family comedy that the public has shown to like. The precedents Il principe abusivo and You accept miracles have grossed the considerable amount of approximately 15 million euros each, proving that Siani's charisma has a certain hold on a large age group.

Mister Happiness therefore aims as much to make people laugh as to excite. Siani alternates the comedic potential of his film, trying to get laughs out of verbal jokes and slapstick situations like the nut machine gun at a restaurant. The differences between wealth and poverty in the first film and between city and province in the second film give way to optimism and pessimism. In the story, the actor plays an indolent unemployed person in Switzerland who lives at the latch of his sister. Mistaken for a mental coach capable of reviving people's motivational instincts, he is in the home of a famous skater who needs ""care"".

The search for poetry is equally important for Siani. The sentimental story with the athlete played by Elena Cucci becomes the pretext to tickle poetry, even visually with sophisticated shots that are particularly accurate and illuminated. Diego Abatantuono and Carla Signoris are the good supporting actors who bring out their characters effortlessly in a context that is actually usable by children and adults, perhaps already sweetened by the Christmas holidays in progress.

",,,,"Diego is a successful entrepreneur. Rich and careless of the good of others, he has no qualms about belittling others. His attitude turns against him when he forgets his latest generation mobile phone to which social profiles, contacts and credit cards are connected in the bathroom of an airport. The two attendants Ivano and Sabino thus decide to take revenge on the arrogant rich man and to exploit the long duration of his flight to Sidney to steal his digital life. While Diego transforms himself into the most hated man on the planet, there are those who take the opportunity to steal the family business from him and screw up his life. Thanks to the help of a beautiful flight attendant and unexpected new friends, the situation is not so irreparable.

The Christmas setting would like to refer to the classic holiday comedies, all misunderstandings and laughter (the declared inspiration is that of the cult film Unachair for two). A partially respected intent, but which is then lost in the impossibility of separating this work, no matter how hard one tries, from the private life of its director.

Fausto Brizzi, overwhelmed last year by the wave of #metoo, was accused by some actresses of sexual harassment. An accusation from which he was then totally acquitted but which cost him the promotional loss of his penultimate film, Poor but very rich, and months of mud machine by television and web programs. A story that questioned his work and forced him to be socially condemned before an actual investigation.

Months later, he returns giving life to his protagonist Diego through whom, without hiding too much behind light comedy narrative gimmicks, he tells of his frustration: the insults on social media, the collapse of a career, the loneliness, but also the newfound confidence in the value of friendship and family.

And as always when a personal story is conveyed to the cinema, the film has something to say. We appreciate the courage and sincerity (at times moving) with which feelings are brought into play, even though we know that an informed public will partly find an intimate confession. On the other hand, those who are unaware of the background (or simply want to call out in favor of a total politics of the work) remain the undisputed experience of a professional who has marked the comedy of our recent cinema.

Vivian is 16 years old and lives with her mother Lisa. She goes to Rockport High School and joins her best friend Claudia. They go to class taught by Mr. Davies. Vivian notices a classmate, Seth, who has gotten more attractive over the summer. Earlier he used to be called Seth The Shrimp. Mr. Davies introduces a new student, Lucy. Mr. Davies begins a discussion of The Great Gatsby, which Lucy criticizes as another tale of a rich white guy expressing sorrow over not having one woman. Mitchell interrupts Lucy’s opinion and defends Gatsby.
Later, Vivian witnesses as Mitchell  ends up taking the soda Lucy was trying to buy, and spits in it. Lucy reports Mitchell to Principal Shelly, who doesn’t want to penalize Mitchell and tries to avoid getting involved in the dilemma. 
At home, Vivian goes through Lisa’s stuff and finds old zines and gets inspired. Next day at school, an incident happens where the jocks list is sent to everyone’s phone where many girls are embarrassed by their superlatives, giving them sexist and perverse opinions and making the girls self-conscious. When Lucy is called a foul word by star jock Mitchell, Vivian becomes inspired by her feminist mother Lisa and starts ""Moxie"", a 'zine aimed at calling out the unfair treatment of girls at the school, and empowering them to come forward with their issues.
Vivian befriends Lucy, as well as a group of other girls who have been put down, but her best friend Claudia is reluctant to get behind the movement and it causes a rift between them. Vivian also starts a relationship with a classmate named Seth, who knows she started Moxie and fully supports her.
After Mitchell wins an athlete award over the girls' candidate, Kiera, Vivian walks home depressed, drinking a bottle of champagne along the way. She comes home to find Lisa with John, and is annoyed that she kept this relationship a secret from her. Vivian then throws up.
Later, the Moxie girls respond to Mitchell’s win by putting crude stickers all over the school. Principal Shelly, who was called out by Moxie for not supporting the girls, attempts to shut down the group. Claudia, who eventually joined the group, takes the fall for it. Vivian then hits a low point when Claudia calls her out for not coming forward (she knew Vivian started Moxie), while also hitting a bump with Seth and Lisa after she yells at them and Lisa's boyfriend John during dinner.
Vivian finds a note from an anonymous girl who claimed to have been raped the previous year. Vivian gets Moxie supporters to stage a walk-out in support of the girl. The majority of students do so, and Vivian reveals to have started Moxie. Head cheerleader Emma comes forward as the girl who wrote the note, stating that Mitchell, her ex, was her rapist. She stands up and reveals to everyone that Mitchell raped her the previous year when they were dating, and him calling her “Most Bangable” left her mortified.

The film was directed by Rob Minkoff from a script by Craig Wright, with Alex Schwartz and Denise Nolan Cascino serving as producers and Tiffany Ward, daughter of series co-creator Jay Ward, serving as executive producer. Mr. Peabody & Sherman features the voices of Ty Burrell, Max Charles, Ariel Winter, Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, and Allison Janney.
It is the first DreamWorks animated feature to feature characters from the Classic Media library since its acquisition by DreamWorks Animation in 2012, the first animated adaptation of a Jay Ward property, and Minkoff's first animated film after having co-directed The Lion King for Walt Disney Animation Studios in 1994.
The film premiered on February 7, 2014 in the United Kingdom, and was released theatrically on March 7, 2014 in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the humor, animation, soundtrack, voice acting, and action scenes. Despite grossing over $275 million worldwide against a budget of $145 million, the film became a box office flop and lost the studio $57 million. A TV series based on the film, titled The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, premiered on Netflix on October 9, 2015, with Chris Parnell replacing Burrell as Mr. Peabody while Charles reprises his role as Sherman.","Section: Plot (1):
Mr. Peabody is a gifted anthropomorphic dog who lives in a penthouse in New York City and raises his adopted human son, 7-year-old Sherman, and tutors him traveling throughout history using the WABAC, pronounced ""way back"", a time machine. They visit Marie Antoinette in Versailles during the French Revolution in 1789. Getting caught in the Reign of Terror, Peabody is nearly sent to the guillotine to be executed by Maximilien Robespierre, but escapes with Sherman through the Paris sewers.
In the present day, Sherman attends the Susan B. Anthony School on his first day, while Peabody struggles to come to terms with Sherman's growing maturity as he fears of losing his bond with him. Sherman's knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the George Washington cherry-tree anecdote leads to a fight with one of his classmates, a bossy girl named Penny Peterson, in the cafeteria where she puts him in a choke hold, accusing him of being a dog due to the fact that he was raised by Peabody. Peabody is called in by Principal Purdy as Sherman had bitten Penny in self-defense, and also confronted by Ms. Grunion, a Child Protective Services agent, who suspects that Sherman's behavior is due to being raised by a dog and plans to visit to their home to investigate whether or not he is an unfit parent. Peabody invites Penny and her parents, Paul and Patty, over for dinner to reconcile before Ms. Grunion arrives. Penny calls Sherman a liar for claiming first-hand knowledge of history. Despite Peabody's contrary instructions, Sherman shows Penny the WABAC to show proof and takes her into the past, where she stays in Ancient Egypt in 1332 BCE to marry King Tut. Sherman returns to get Peabody's help. Peabody hypnotizes the Petersons and heads to Egypt to stop the wedding. Penny initially refuses to leave, hoping to achieve Tut's riches after he dies, until she is informed that she as well will be killed alongside Tut during the wedding and escapes with Peabody and Sherman.
While trying to return, the WABAC runs out of power, so they stop at Renaissance Florence in 1508 where they meet Leonardo da Vinci and Lisa del Giocondo, pioneering Mona Lisa's famous smile. Penny and Sherman explore da Vinci's attic and find his flying machine. Penny goads Sherman into flying it, which he manages to do before crashing. Da Vinci is thrilled the device works, but Peabody is upset that Sherman was almost killed, while also having destroyed a historical artifact. When they resume their journey, Sherman learns of Ms. Grunion's plot to take him away and enters a fight with Peabody. As they feud, a black hole in time makes them crash-land during the Trojan War in 1184 BCE. Upset about Peabody not trusting him, Sherman runs away and joins the army of King Agamemnon in the Trojan Horse, but reconciles with him during the battle. During the final parts of the Trojan War, Penny and Sherman are trapped inside the Horse as it rolls towards a ravine. Peabody saves them but seemingly dies during the attempt, causing Sherman to break down in tears while Penny comforts him.
Feeling bad for his actions, Sherman decides to go home and pilots the WABAC to a few minutes before they left in the present to get Mr. Peabody's help to fix everything, despite Peabody's earlier warnings to never return to a time when they existed. As Sherman and Penny try to explain the situation, Sherman's earlier self shows up. When Grunion arrives, Peabody tries to conceal from the Petersons the presence of two Shermans; but the second Peabody arrives back from Ancient Troy, complicating the situation. Troy Peabody reveals he survived the crash, much to Sherman's relief. Grunion attempts to collect both Shermans, but they and the Peabodys merge back together, causing a massive cosmic shockwave. Grunion grabs Sherman to take him away for good, to which an enraged Peabody reverts to his natural dog instincts and furiously bites Grunion in retaliation, who then calls the New York Police Department. Peabody, Penny, and Sherman race to the WABAC, but cannot time-travel due to a rip in the space-time continuum caused by the merger of their cosmic doubles. The collision caused a portal to appear above New York and historic objects and figures, many from earlier parts of the story, rain down everywhere in the city.
Mr. Peabody crash-lands the WABAC in Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan) at the base of William Tecumseh Sherman's statue. Historical figures and police officers quickly surround them, while Grunion calls in animal control to arrest Peabody. Sherman explains that everything was his fault, but Grunion contends that it is all because a dog cannot raise a boy. Sherman counters Grunion by saying that if being a dog means being as loving and loyal as Peabody is, then he is proud to be a dog, too. Penny, her parents, the historical figures, and others all make the same pledge. George Washington grants Peabody a presidential pardon which is supported by Abraham Lincoln and Bill Clinton, forcing the authorities to leave Mr. Peabody alone. When larger objects such as the Sphinx, the RMS Titanic and the Florence Cathedral begin falling through the rip, the people of the present and the past are forced to brainstorm ideas to prevent disaster. To close the rip, Peabody and Sherman take off in the WABAC, travel into the future for a few minutes, and undo the damage. The historical figures are dragged back to their respective times, with Agamemnon abducting Grunion back to his own time as she vows revenge on Peabody.
Sherman returns to school, having become great friends with Penny. History, meanwhile, is contaminated with modern traits, with Tut throwing a New York-themed party, da Vinci and del Giocondo pioneering pop art, Washington and Benjamin Franklin competing over the value of the banknotes with their respective faces on them, Albert Einstein going into a rage upon being unable to solve a Rubik's Cube, Robespierre failing to use a taser properly, and Grunion and Agamemnon getting married in the Trojan Horse by Odysseus.

Section: Development (2):
Plans for a film starring Mister Peabody and Sherman have existed for several years with director Rob Minkoff. His first attempt to make a feature film goes to 2003, when it was reported that Minkoff's Sony-based production company Sprocketdyne Entertainment and Bullwinkle Studios would produce a live-action/CG film, with a possibility of Minkoff to direct it.The live-action film was not realized, but in 2006, Minkoff joined DreamWorks Animation to direct a computer-animated film adaptation. Andrew Kurtzman was set to write the screenplay, based on the pitch, developed by Minkoff with his longtime producing partner Jason Clark. The final screenplay was written by Craig Wright, with revisions by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon.
Tiffany Ward, daughter of Jay Ward, one of the creators of the original series, served as an executive producer, whose job was to make sure the film stayed ""true to the integrity of the characters."" When she was approached by Minkoff ten years before the film's release, she was enthused by his intention to respect the legacy: ""What better caretaker for the characters could we ask for than Rob."" The process to make the adaptation ""perfect"" took them a long time, but she was pleased with the end result, which stayed ""very true to the original cartoon.""

Section: Casting (2):
In early 2011, Robert Downey Jr. signed on to voice Mr. Peabody, but in March 2012, he was replaced by Ty Burrell. Reportedly, Downey's commitments to The Avengers and other franchises did not allow him to find the time to record his lines. Initially, Tiffany Ward and others at the studio opposed Burrell, who was then relatively unknown, but he managed to convince them with a successful audition. Ward insisted on someone who sounds like Mr. Peabody did in the original series, while Minkoff saw the casting as an opportunity ""to modernize the character."" He promised her that Burrell would try to ""get there and he started watching the show to nail the cadence. He got the underlying connection and he made it his own.""Max Charles, the actor who played young Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man, voiced Sherman. Stephen Colbert voiced Paul Peterson, Leslie Mann, who replaced Ellie Kemper, voiced Peterson's wife, Patty, and Ariel Winter voiced their daughter Penny. Other voices include Stephen Tobolowsky, Allison Janney, Mel Brooks, Stanley Tucci, Patrick Warburton, Lake Bell, Zach Callison, Karan Brar, and Dennis Haysbert. According to Minkoff, Burrell was chosen because his voice ""embodied all the different aspects of the character today. Not just the intellect and the suave personality, but the underlying warmth as well.""

Furthermore, the CinemaScore audience rating of the film is an ""A"", indicating they were pleased with the film.Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said: ""(The film) takes a little while for the audience to get up to speed, but once this is achieved, there's an awful lot of unexpected fun to be had,"" while Mark Kermode of the sister paper The Observer declared, ""Pleasant to report, then, that DreamWorks' latest offers a fairly consistent stream of sight gags and vocal slapstick, even as the plot veers wildly down a wormhole in the time-space continuum."" Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying, ""Unlike the whimsical, slapstick-driven shorts on which it's based, this feature-length adaptation adds an obligatory emotional arc that feels at odds with the zany spirit of historical time-travel tales."" A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying, ""This DreamWorks Animation production, directed by Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little, The Lion King) from a screenplay by Craig Wright, is not perfect, but it is fast-moving, intermittently witty and pretty good fun."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a B, saying, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a whip-smart, consistently funny and good-natured film with some terrific voice performances and one of the most hilarious appearances ever by an animated version of a living human being."" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman is lively, educational and intermittently amusing. The fun, however, grows strained and formulaic as the movie goes on."" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two out of four stars, saying, ""The film's animation design is strictly generic in its rounded edges and dutiful 3-D IN YOUR FACE!!! gimmicks. And the story gets off to such a sour start, it takes a long time for the comedy to recover.""Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying, ""It retains the main characters, the WABAC machine, the trips through history – but not the sense of nuttiness that made the TV cartoon so delightful."" Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""What a relief to see that while Mr. Peabody's visuals are enhanced to sleek 21st-century standards, the essential charm of the series survives more or less intact."" Elizabeth Weitzman of New York Daily News gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""Burrell doesn't quite capture the wry deadpan of the original, but then, neither does the movie. That's okay."" Bruce Demara of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""Kids of all ages are sure to enjoy this visually splendid, fast-paced blast through the past."" Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, saying, ""For all the ways the film reflects its earlier TV incarnation, the shadings have been softened. Mr. Peabody could use a bit more bite."" Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Frantically paced by director Rob Minkoff (The Lion King) and making very effective use of 3D – Hey! Get that sword out of my face! – the movie will surely appeal to kids."" Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""The movie has trouble stitching together disjointed episodes into a coherent narrative. Thanks to a strong voice cast, however, the characters retain their charm throughout.""Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying, ""The film's saving grace is its character design and use of 3D techniques to speed things up in every sense when the plot starts to flag."" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Mr. Peabody is fast-paced and jammed with rib-poking historical references, but it couldn't be called witty, even on the broadly winking level of the original cartoon."" Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""Fifty years ago, animated entertainment was a lot quieter. But that was my Mr. Peabody & Sherman. This is someone else's. And it should give them, and even a few open-minded parents, almost just as much giggly fun."" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a zesty time mixing and matching historical figures, from Marie Antoinette to George Washington. Yet the movie never, to my mind, conjured quite the quirky effervescence of such brainiac animated features as the Jimmy Neutron or SpongeBob SquarePants movies."" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film one out of four stars, saying, ""By visual standards alone, the characters, rendered in eye-popping 3-D, resemble nothing so much as Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade floats. They're just as lifeless and inexpressive, too."" Sean Daly of the Tampa Bay Times gave the film a B, saying, ""Before getting sucked into a what-the-wormhole ending that will scramble young brains, time-travel romp Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a fast, fun 3-D getaway.""Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""Against all odds, DreamWorks Animation has created a smart, funny and beautifully designed feature called Mr. Peabody & Sherman."" Tom Huddleston of Time Out gave the film two out of five stars, saying, ""This feature-length Mr Peabody & Sherman is by no means unbearable: there are a few decent gags, and the episodic plot just about manages to hold the interest. But there's little here for any but the most easy-to-please youngsters."" Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, ""The film spent roughly a dozen years in development, and the moronic, corporate detritus from that long time warp is strewn about like so many improbable history lessons."" Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a cool, midcentury-modern look (dog and boy live in a populuxe Manhattan penthouse) and a voice cast that may not be A-list but fits the bill nicely."" David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four out of five stars, saying, ""It's sweet-natured and amusing, with a story to captivate kids; yet the script has enough witty touches to keep adults laughing too."" Perry Seibert, writing for AllMovie, gave the movie two stars out of five, calling the movie ""long, loud, and visually exhausting"" and saying that it ""feels less like an attempt to update a boomer classic for millennials than a prime example of how lazy marketing guys hold sway over what movies get made.""

The League of Villains is pursued by Endeavor and Hawks, while driving off in a truck carrying mysterious cargo. The heroes destroy the truck, but fail to apprehend the League members, and find an empty life support capsule inside. The man inside, a villain named Nine, has escaped and regroups with his team of villains, planning to create a society where those with strong Quirks rule over others.
U.A. High's Class 1-A has been sent to the remote Nabu Island as part of a safety program. Izuku Midoriya, the holder of One for All, meets Mahoro Shimano, and her brother Katsuma, residents of the island. Bonding with them along with his rival Katsuki Bakugo, they discover that Katsuma wishes to become a hero, but Mahoro seeks to dissuade him.
Meanwhile, Mahoro and Katsuma's father is attacked by Nine and his party, with Nine stealing his Quirk. Nine, who has been empowered by All For One, can steal and possess up to nine Quirks, but his body cannot handle these Quirks without suffering damage. He seeks to use the stolen Quirk to heal himself, becoming near-invincible, but it is incompatible with his blood type. Nine surmises that the man's children might possess a better variant of it, and pursues them.
Nine and his gang arrive on the island and destroy all means of escape and communication. Class 1-A learns of the invasion and split up to stop the villains and protect the island residents. Nine finds the children and confirms Katsuma possesses the Quirk he seeks, but Midoriya intervenes before he can steal it; however, neither he nor Bakugo are a match against Nine. Despite this, they force him to retreat due to overusing his Quirks.
Class 1-A regroups and decide to attack the villains head-on, while awaiting the arrival of other heroes. Upon evacuating the islanders, the class manage to defeat the rest of Nine's crew, but are incapacitated by Nine, except for Midoriya and Bakugo. Seeing no other way to defeat Nine, Midoriya transfers One For All into Bakugo, while he uses its leftover embers. Together, the two defeat Nine, but Midoriya's One For All seemingly fades afterwards.
As professional heroes arrive, All Might finds an unconscious Bakugo and Midoriya. He realizes that One For All remains within Midoriya, as the transfer into Bakugo was interrupted, theorizing that the previous wielders of One For All wish for Midoriya to keep it. Elsewhere, Tomura Shigaraki finds and kills the weakened Nine out of spite.
With Nine's gang apprehended, the class repair damage to the island before returning home. Midoriya and Bakugo, who has lost memory of wielding One For All, say goodbye to Katsuma and Mahoro. The movie ends as Midoriya assures Katsuma he can become a hero, as All Might had done for him previously.

In 1870, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a former member of the Confederate Army who served in the 3rd Texas Infantry, makes a living traveling town to town reading newspapers for the populace for ten cents per person. Following an evening of news reading, setting out for his next location, Kidd finds an overturned wagon on the road. Investigating, he finds the body of a Black soldier and a young White girl named Johanna, dressed in Native American clothing. After an encounter with a Union Army patrol, Kidd is instructed to take the girl to Union officials at a checkpoint in a town up the road where they will sort out her Bureau of Indian Affairs paperwork and return her to her surviving family. Reluctantly, Kidd acquiesces to the request.
At the checkpoint Kidd is informed that the Bureau of Indian Affairs representative won't be available for three months. Seeking shelter with a former Confederate infantryman, Kidd reads the news and upon returning, begrudgingly accepts responsibility for taking her to her surviving family. As they set out they have difficulty communicating. This is compounded more when Kidd is confronted by three ex-Confederate soldiers turned criminals who try to purchase the girl from Kidd. He refuses, but the three men pursue, leading to a shootout in the wilderness during which Johanna and Kidd learn to work together to survive.
Next they encounter a radical band of militia working to ""cleanse"" the county from ""outsiders"". Kidd is told to read the approved news from the town's leader, but instead reads about a group of coal miners who rally against the man responsible for putting their lives in jeopardy. Kidd’s story incites civil unrest, and ultimately results in Johanna gunning down the town's leader and rescuing Kidd. In the aftermath, Kidd and Johanna initially join a wagon train bound for the railroad line then veer off to locate Johanna’s surviving family. During the journey the wagon is destroyed, leaving Johanna and Kidd to continue on foot until they find a group of Kiowa from whom Johanna is able to obtain a horse.
Kidd and Johanna eventually reach her aunt and uncle's farmstead, the former revealing that Johanna's parents had struck out on their own and moved to hill country where the land would be cheaper; this led to them being killed in a Kiowa raid. Kidd reluctantly leaves Johanna with them, and returns to San Antonio. His wife, Maria Luisa Betancourt Kidd, died from cholera in 1865. Now without any kin, he visits the mission where she is buried, and mournfully leaves his wedding ring and a locket on her grave.
Kidd then rides back to the village where he left Johanna, where he finds her tied to a pole, her aunt and uncle explaining that she refused to work and would instead run off. Asking forgiveness, Kidd tells Johanna (in Kiowa) that she belongs with him. Johanna accepts; her aunt and uncle let them go. In an epilogue, Kidd reads the papers in another town, with a joyful Johanna now part of the routine,  helping out on sound effects, and bearing a new name: Johanna Kidd.

Review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 255 reviews of the film were positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""News of the World takes a slow but absorbing ride down a comfortingly familiar Western trail, guided by Tom Hanks in peak paternal mode."" According to Metacritic, which sampled 45 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, the film received ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.Writing for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of B and said, ""If Greengrass' broadly entertaining (if gallingly relevant) film is a bit too soft and spread thin to hit with the emotional force that it could, so much of its simple power is owed to the grounded nature of the director's approach, which allows these desperate characters to feel as if they're trying to escape the very genre that threatens to define them forever."" A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a ""B–"" and wrote: ""Ultimately, News Of The World lives and dies on the presence of its iconic headliner, on the Hanks of it all. That's the most old-fashioned thing about it: It's a true star vehicle, practically a tribute to his enduring appeal. Yet for as comforting as Hanks is in the role, and for as much as he sells the poignancy of the film's bittersweet final stretch, the film feels almost too built around his signature nobility to ever gain much in the way of actual drama."" Mark Kermode of The Observer awarded the film 4/5 stars and wrote ""Having emerged from news documentaries to become a peerless director of vivid real-life dramas (Bloody Sunday, United 93) and frenetically visceral adventures (The Bourne franchise), Greengrass relishes the opportunity to take a more languorous attitude to character development and location, a quality that seems to have confounded some fans of the director’s more urgent fare. Yet I found this a rewarding and entertaining drama, heavy with the weight of the past, yet buoyed up by the possibilities of the future.""Contrasting views display the comments on the movie by Philipp Emberger, the critic of ORF, the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation: under the title ""Helena Zengel Overpowering Tom Hanks"" he describes her scenes as the highlights of the film, compared to Tom Hanks' solos that seem ""arduously one-dimensional"", concluding that ""Tom Hanks delivers a lot of forgivingness, besides the Dad-vibes"", which makes the film ""a quiet and steady Western with elements of road-movie, beautiful pictures of landscapes, a relevant topic, lots of heart, and a star named Helena Zengel."" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 2/5 stars, writing that although Hanks' ""persona here is equable and easy-going, qualities which are of course necessary to his sympathetic brand identity, he doesn’t plausibly change in any dramatic way"" and describing the film as a ""handsomely shot but stolid and blandly self-satisfied western"". A.O Scott of The New York Times gave a similarly mixed review, writing that ""this isn’t a bad movie. The problem is that it’s too nice a movie, too careful and compromised, as if its makers didn’t trust the audience to handle the real news of the world.""Tom Gliatto of People named it the fifth best film of the year.

Lee was criticized for not using creative choices to differentiate his work, in essence to justify why he made it. The film was also a box office bomb, and was one of the worst box office performances of Lee's directing career.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1993, alcoholic advertising executive Joe Doucett gets drunk and has sex after losing a major account. Before he passes out, he sees a woman with a yellow umbrella. When he wakes, he finds himself locked in what appears to be a hotel room. His unseen captors provide him food, alcohol, and personal hygiene items, but do not explain why he is held captive. Joe sees a news report saying his ex-wife Donna was raped and murdered and that he is the prime suspect. Their 3-year-old daughter Mia was adopted through the welfare system.
Over the next 20 years, Joe quits drinking and gets into shape, intent on escaping and getting revenge. He compiles a list of all those who might want to imprison him, and writes letters to eventually give to Mia. One day, he sees a televised interview with Mia, who says she would forgive her father if she ever saw him.
Joe is drugged shortly thereafter. When he wakes, he is outside in a trunk in a field, with a cellphone and a small amount of money. He spots the woman with the yellow umbrella and gives chase; he loses her but encounters Marie Sebastian, a nurse who offers to help. He refuses the help, but takes her business card. Joe goes to his friend Chucky's bar, and explains what has taken place. While there, Joe receives a call on the cellphone from a man calling himself the ""Stranger,"" who mocks him. Joe spends a great deal of effort, with no success, to determine if any of the men on his list is the Stranger. Joe collapses from dehydration, and Chucky calls Marie to help. While he recovers, Marie is moved emotionally by Joe's letters to Mia and offers to help him further. She helps him identify a Chinese restaurant which supplied his food while he was held captive.
Joe follows a delivery from the restaurant to a warehouse where he was imprisoned, and meets Chaney, its owner. Joe tortures Chaney by flaying his neck with a Stanley knife, and he confesses that the Stranger arranged for Joe's captivity. Upon returning to Chucky's bar, Joe finds the Stranger there with the woman with the yellow umbrella, his bodyguard Haeng-bok. The Stranger says they have kidnapped Mia, but if Joe can determine, in 46 hours, the Stranger's identity and why he held Joe captive for 20 years, he'll release Mia, give Joe $20 million in diamonds, proof of Joe's innocence in Donna's murder, and commit suicide.
Joe learns that Chaney and his men are seeking revenge by attacking Marie. After racing to her house, he is captured by Chaney. Just as Chaney is about to cut and torture him, the Stranger calls Chaney and offers to pay him for Joe's release. Chaney releases Joe and Marie. Using a music recognition app on her phone, Marie determines that the ringtone from the Stranger's call is the theme song of Evergreen Academy, which Joe had attended, but is now closed and shuttered.
Marie visits the school headmistress's home; Joe sneaks in a back door and finds his yearbook where he recognizes a student, Adrian Doyle Pryce. Joe passes the name to Chucky then hides Marie in a hotel for her safety. There they have passionate sex, unaware that Adrian is watching through hidden cameras. Chucky does some internet sleuthing and leaves a message for Joe revealing that it's about Adrian's sister. Adrian intercepts and deletes the message before Joe hears it, and because Chucky insulted Adrian's sister, he garrots Chucky to death with piano wire. Marie and Joe enter the Evergreen Academy grounds, and find the school's records regarding Adrian and Amanda. Joe recalls bullying Amanda, and seeing Amanda having sex with an older man in the greenhouse. Back at the car, they find a package with Chucky's tongue inside.
Joe goes to Adrian's penthouse, kills Haeng-bok by slitting her throat, and confronts Adrian. Adrian congratulates him for answering the two questions correctly. Adrian's and Amanda's father Arthur is revealed to have sexually abused both his children. Arthur moved his family to Luxembourg, where he later murdered his wife and Amanda, attempted to murder Adrian, and committed suicide. Adrian, who has convinced himself that his father's abuse was an expression of love, blames the destruction of his family on Joe, who revealed their secret. Arthur gives him the diamonds and evidence, and escorts him to sets used to fabricate the media watched by Joe in the warehouse. Adrian taunts Joe by questioning why he was released at all; his tormentor shows that the interview with ""Mia"" was a setup; the girl, now a woman, was a paid actress. Adrian reveals that Marie is really Joe's own daughter; Adrian wanted Joe to know what it felt like to lose everything. Adrian commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth.
Horrified, Joe writes Marie a letter saying they can never see each other again. He leaves her most of the diamonds, using the rest to pay Chaney to return him to the captivity of the hotel room.

In November 2008, DreamWorks and Universal were securing the rights to the remake, which Will Smith had expressed interest in starring, with Steven Spielberg as director. Mark Protosevich was in talks to write the script, although the acquisition to the remake rights were not finalized. Smith later clarified that Spielberg would not be remaking the film: he would be adapting the manga itself, which is considerably different from the film. In June 2009, the comic's publisher launched a lawsuit against the Korean film's producers for giving the film rights to Spielberg without their permission.

","A film that for many has acted as a gateway to South Korean cinema, Oldboy, the second part of Park Chan-wook’s ‘Vengeance Trilogy’ is also his most infamous. Still revered today across all kinds of screen arts, its most famous sequence, a virtuoso single-take hallway fight, has inspired various imitators for well over a decade. But what makes Oldboy special is its consideration of the violence that it portrays – with each blow of the hammer, the film responds: “even though I am no better than a beast, don’t I have the right to live?”

Based on a manga of the same name, Oldboy is the story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), the film’s protagonist and victim. He’s introduced as an ordinary white-collar businessman, missing his daughter’s birthday after a night of drinking lands him at the police station. Shortly after being bailed out, he disappears without a trace, imprisoned for 15 years and then suddenly released with no explanation as to why, left with five days to find the answer.

His captivity brings a desire for revenge which turns out to be equal to that of his captor, who is just as violent and spiteful, but infinitely more sadistic. No definitive judgement is cast on whether or not Dae-su is a good man, Chung Chung-hoon’s camerawork observing him with almost impartial remove. As his captor says: “I’m sort of a scholar, and what I study is you”. And so, we the audience join him in viewing his metamorphosis. This isn’t to say that Oldboy is a cold movie; if anything it’s highly emotive at every turn. A lot of care is put into creating Dae-su, as he changes into a beastly yet captivating agent of vengeance, then into someone who might actually have the hope of becoming a better human being.

The first act follows a fairly conventional revenge thriller template, with exhilarating fight scenes filmed with clarity and grit. But the violence is rarely satisfying. As the film moves into its final act, every bloody action is near unbearable – even though it’s mostly implied – as though it’s too great a horror to be seen. It’s also worth noting that it’s a far funnier film than its reputation would suggest, mixing tragedy and pitch-black humour from the jump.

The chief pleasure and horror of this film lies in Park’s slow twisting of the knife into Dae-su’s side, taking away any kind of temporary satisfaction with each new humiliation – the final turn being the most improbable and deliriously twisted. Fifteen years on, Oldboy has lost none of its capacity to shock and delight.",5.7,69779,"Action, Drama, Mystery ",Positive,0.982

It stars Anthony Mackie (who also produced) as an android officer who works with a drone pilot (Damson Idris) to stop a global catastrophe. Emily Beecham, Michael Kelly, and Pilou Asbæk also star. The film was released by Netflix on January 15, 2021, and received mixed reviews from critics.","Section: Plot (1):
In 2036, a civil war between pro-Russian insurgents and local resistances in Ukraine leads the US to deploy peacekeeping forces. During an operation, a team of United States Marines and ""Gumps"" (robotic soldiers) are ambushed. Disobeying an order, drone pilot 1st Lt. Harp deploys a Hellfire missile in a drone strike against a suspected enemy launcher, killing two Marines but saving 38. As punishment, Harp is sent to Camp Nathaniel, the US base of operations in Ukraine where he is assigned to Captain Leo, a highly advanced and experimental android super-soldier masquerading as a human officer.Harp and Leo set out on a mission to prevent terrorist Victor Koval from gaining control of a network of Cold War–era nuclear missile silos, under the cover of delivering vaccines to a refugee camp. On the way, they respond to a reported attack on a friendly aid truck, resulting in a stand-off between the Marines and armed locals. After a Gump shoots a local who threw a rock at the Gump, Captain Leo negotiates a peaceful solution by giving the locals the contents of the aid truck. However, pro-Russian insurgents ambush the locals and Marines, leading to a firefight. This forces Leo and Harp to travel to the refugee camp on foot, while the Marines remain behind to engage the insurgents.  
After arriving at the refugee compound, Leo and Harp are shot at by an insurgent, who kills some civilians. Leo tortures the insurgent for information, before leaving him to be killed by the gathered mob. Leo and Harp meet their contact Sofiya, a resistance leader. Sofiya leads them to an arms dealer who knows the location of a bank vault containing nuclear launch codes that Koval is looking for. Harp and Leo travel to the bank, and are met by Koval's forces which include Gumps. While Harp helps rescue civilians caught in a crossfire between US and Russian Gumps, Leo retrieves the codes but cannot find Koval. A drone strike called in by Eckhart destroys the bank and several buildings, leading the military command to believe both Koval dead and Leo destroyed.
Harp reunites with Leo who tells him that he has his own plans for the codes, and has been manipulating Harp into helping him evade the eye of military command. He knocks out Harp and leaves him on the side of the road where he is picked up by Sofiya's men. Leo meets with Koval to give him the codes, but kills him when Koval refuses to give Leo access to a nuclear missile silo. Harp informs Sofiya and his commander of Leo's actions, and they realize Leo is planning to launch the nuclear missiles at the United States, in order to prevent them from fighting more wars in the future. Harp volunteers to infiltrate the silo and finds Leo has taken over. He disables Leo but not before Leo initiates the launch of a missile, explaining that his goal was for the android super-soldier program to end in failure. Harp escapes as the silo is destroyed by a drone strike before the missile can launch; destroying Leo. Harp returns to Camp Nathaniel and receives praise from his commander, who informs him that he is returning home. Harp then leaves the base.

",,"All over Istanbul, entrepreneurial scavengers pull junk carts, filling the canvas bags on those carts with recyclable cans, liquor bottles and especially cardboard.

A lot of them are orphans, the street children of the city who grew up on this work, running carts for a go-between who pays them for their collections and sells those recyclables on.

In “Paper Lives,” Mehmet (Çagatay Ulusoy) is the Fagan to a gang of these junk-collecting Oliver Twists, feeding the kids and young adults donuts as they head out, paying them off when they return, taking an interest in them because he grew up the same way.

Mehmet is saving up his litter-loot for something, nothing that’s on the “bucket list” he and his best collector Gonzi (Ersin Arici) came up with years back.

“Ride in a convertible,” (in Turkish with subtitles, or dubbed into English), “fly on an airplane…stay in a luxury hotel…find my mother.”

We meet Mehmet knocking on death’s door. A trip to the emergency room reveals that he has kidney failure, has known about it for some time and has been saving up for the day when this rationed health care system finds him a kidney. As it’s his “turn” to get dialysis, he fights off death for another day. But all he frets over is the frantic mother (Selen Öztürk) who dashes into the ER with a little boy who’s stopped breathing.

When he stumbles across a little boy named Ali (Emir Ali Dogrul) stowed away in one of those collection bags, turning him out or calling the cops never figure into his thinking. No, he’s going to “save” this child, maybe get him back to mother the boy claims helped him escape a cruel stepfather.

Screenwriter Ercan Mehmet Erdem and director Can Ulkay introduce us to a fascinating underworld operating in broad daylight of veterans of the carting trade who fend off rival collectors, hide from the cops and know all the tricks for collecting what has value and making a quick get-away when others covet it, too.

Early scenes have a “Man Push Cart” flavor, lots of details of how this off-the-books economy works. Liquor bottles with their caps have value because black marketeers refill them with cheap knockoffs and re-sell them at premium prices, for instance. They carry on with their work as the affluent — locals and foreigners — weave in and out of traffic in luxury cars on their way to chic hotels that the paparazzi stake out for work.

Mehmet is a sort of benign, somewhat shady eminence in his little corner of the world — giving cash to street urchins, making them promise they won’t spend it on glue to sniff.

But “Paper Lives” quickly descends into a sort of overwrought madness the moment the little boy arrives. Mehmet’s behavior is soap opera meltdown over-the-top. He protects the child, lashes out at threats to the child’s wellbeing and threatens even his most intimate friends when they’re not all-in and on-board this little experiment on orphan-raising-an-orphan child rearing.

Ulusoy’s near-hysteria in many moments reminded me of Italian neo-realism pictures like “Bicycle Thieves,” the least realistic parts of those films.

The hero’s histrionics and the fact that the viewer can guess the solution to the “mystery” too soon lessen its impact. But the attention to detail, taking us into this world of Artful Istanbul Dumpster Divers, holds one’s interest throughout.

Little Ali may drive the plot and present obstacles to Mehmet’s life-saving kidney surgery. But one can’t help but think his story, and the movie about him, would have been more interesting and less maudlin and melodramatic had the screenwriter found something more interesting to do with the child.",6.5,7088,Drama,Positive,0.927

It is the second adaptation of the 1983 novel of the same name by Stephen King, after the 1989 film. The film stars Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, and John Lithgow, and follows a family that discovers a mysterious graveyard in the woods behind their new home.
Talks for a new adaptation of Pet Sematary began in March 2010, with Greenberg initially writing the screenplay. Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Steven Schneider were revealed to be producing the remake with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo in talks to direct it. By December 2017, Paramount Pictures had greenlit this new film version of King's novel, with duo filmmakers Kölsch and Widmyer directing. Principal photography commenced on June 18, 2018, in Montreal and Hudson, Quebec, Canada, and wrapped on August 11, 2018.
Pet Sematary premiered at South by Southwest festival on March 16, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 5, 2019, by Paramount Pictures. The film grossed over $113 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the dark tone, atmosphere and performances, but disliked the slow pacing and reliance on jump scares. Critics and audiences were both divided on the changes between the film and book, though many named it better than the 1989 adaptation.","Section: Plot (1):
Louis Creed, an emergency physician from Boston, Massachusetts, moves to the small town of Ludlow, Maine with his wife, Rachel, their two young children, Ellie and Gage, and Ellie's cat, Church. Exploring the woods, Rachel and Ellie stumble across a funeral procession of children taking a dead dog to a cemetery called ""Pet Sematary."" At the university hospital, Louis is left shaken after failing to save the life of Victor Pascow, a student who was fatally injured after being struck and dragged by a vehicle. He later experiences a vivid dream in which Victor leads him to the deadfall at the back of the cemetery and warns him not to ""venture beyond."" Louis awakens to find his feet and sheets caked in mud, suggesting that the events were more than just a nightmare.
On Halloween, Church is killed by a truck. Jud Crandall, their neighbor who has a soft spot for Ellie, takes Louis past the pet cemetery to an ancient burial ground to bury Church. The next day, Louis is stunned when Church returns home alive, though he is different: aggressive and violent, tearing apart a bird and eating it alive. Jud reveals to Louis that the burial ground brings things back from the dead and is believed to be inhabited by a spirit known as the Wendigo. He apologizes, having thought Church would return the same. After Church attacks Gage, Louis unsuccessfully attempts to euthanize him and instead decides to set him free in the wild.
During her birthday party, Ellie spots Church on the road and excitedly rushes to him, but is hit and killed by a derailed tanker truck. The family is devastated, and Rachel and Gage leave to spend a few days with Rachel's parents. Sensing that Louis is planning on resurrecting Ellie, Jud warns the grieving father that ""sometimes dead is better."" Though Victor's spirit similarly warns him, Louis's grief spurs him to carry out his plan. He drugs Jud, exhumes Ellie's corpse, and reburies her in the animal graveyard as the Wendigo looks on. Ellie rises from the dead but manifests a disturbing demeanor.
Meanwhile, Rachel is frightened by visions of her dead sister Zelda, who suffered from spinal meningitis and died after falling down a dumbwaiter shaft. Gage is also frightened by the ghost of Victor who tries to warn him about going home. Jud wakes up and spots Ellie in the house. He flees home in horror to retrieve his revolver, but Jud, distracted by a growling Church, allows Ellie to surprise him on the stairwell—slicing through Jud's Achilles tendon with a scalpel and taunting him with the voice of his dead wife before viciously stabbing him to death.
Rachel and Gage return home and encounter the undead Ellie. Rachel is horrified and flees with Gage to an upstairs bedroom. Ellie, enraged at being rejected by her mother, attacks Rachel as Louis finds Jud's blood-soaked body. Rushing home, Louis manages to save Gage just as Ellie fatally stabs Rachel. He locks Gage in the car, and Rachel begs her husband not to bury her in the pet cemetery. Ellie knocks Louis unconscious and drags her mother's body to the burial ground. At the pet cemetery, Ellie tries to kill Louis. As Louis prepares to decapitate his daughter, he is impaled by a weather vane by a reanimated Rachel and is subsequently buried as she was. Along with Church, the undead trio set fire to Jud's house before approaching the car. The resurrected Louis peers into the car at Gage before a beeping sound of unlocking is heard and the screen cuts to black.
In an alternate ending released on home media, Louis spares Ellie instead of killing her, and they both bury Rachel behind the pet cemetery, promising that they will be a family together forever. After burning Jud's house, Louis and Ellie approach the family car, where Gage is still locked in. In the house, Ellie, Church, and a newly resurrected Rachel approach and reunite with an unhappy Louis holding Gage, who is crying.

Principal photography began on December 3, 2019 in Montreal, Canada, and lasted until the end of January 2020.The film is noted for its 24-minute long take labor scene at the start, dubbed ""The Scene"" by The Guardian's Adrian Horton. Prior to shooting, Mundruczó sent Kirby materials to inspire her performance of labor, including footage of home births, but wanted the actors to make their own performance choices; there were no marks to hit in the scene, LaBeouf came up with the bad jokes used in the scene himself, and the production team would not show the cast any of the stage performance so as not to overly influence them. Kirby also spent time shadowing midwives on a maternity ward to learn about the experience of childbirth, as she has not given birth herself. Director of photography Benjamin Loeb also physically trained beforehand so that he would have the strength to carry a gimbal-loaded camera for the whole take, though the shoot still negatively impacted his health. He chose the gimbal as he wanted a ""floaty"" quality to the scene to represent the baby's perspective and felt that using a hand-held camera would make it look too much like a documentary.The scene was filmed six times over two days, four times on one day and twice the next, with one camera; it was the first scene shot for the film and took up over 30 pages in the script. The choice to use a single take stemmed from the play on which the film is based, which featured a live video feed captured by a camera freely roaming the stage as part of the performance. Loeb said that they ""wanted to make sure that the sequence felt like it was presented as a long-winded breath in some ways"". The fourth of the six takes was used; though less technically accurate than the takes on the second day, Mundruczó felt it was more alive.Set within the couple's apartment, the scene was filmed in a real house. It had large archways that allowed Loeb and the cast movement – Kirby was encouraged to make use of the space if she wanted to – except for the bathroom door; Mundruczó initially wanted to pass in and out of the bathroom three times but this was reduced to once to limit the possibility of the shot being ruined. He had chosen the house because it had the same layout as the set design of their play. Before shooting, one practice run was taken; filmed on Loeb's phone, the practice took 38 minutes. Mundruczó did not do another practice, telling Vulture that ""if you are very choreographed, then the whole shot can be really cold and calculated, [and] when you don't fix anything, it [can] become a Dogme style of shaking camera."" A real baby was used in the scene, with a CGI umbilical cord; the baby was held by its mother just outside the apartment and brought in off-camera for the moment of birth. Mundruczó and Kirby both felt the real baby was integral to the film. Other realism was achieved in the scene: partway through the scene, Sean frantically searches for a phone to call 9-1-1, and in about half of the takes, including the final cut, LaBeouf really struggled to remember where the prop was placed.Richard Brody of The New Yorker described the scene as a ""mere stunt"", saying that it is emotionally empty until the last moments and its significance to the rest of the film is an ""ultimately pointless symbolic function: as evidence."" Vulture's Hillary Kelly instead felt that the scene ""is a technical trick, but an emotional lever, too, a reminder that labor is a process you cannot wriggle out of once it has begun.""

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Pieces of a Woman struggles to maintain momentum after a stunning opening act, but Vanessa Kirby's performance makes the end result a poignant portrait of grief."" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".Xan Brooks of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing: ""Viewed as an acting masterclass, the film is bruisingly impressive in its way. The principal actors raise the roof; each gets to do their big turn for the camera. But it feels a little schooled, a little staged, like a workshop at the Actors' Studio; this impression isn't helped by the over-insistent score, which drops like a lead weight after each full-throated exchange.""Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge said, ""But this is ultimately Kirby's movie, as the stage marvel (better known to audiences for her work on The Crown) delivers her most impressive screen performance to date—not just the remarkable commitment of that childbirth scene, but the way she navigates the character's uncertainty for the rest of the movie."" The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said that ""those with the stomach for a forcefully acted representation of the gut-wrenching impact and long-range after-effects of sudden infant death will be rewarded with moments both powerful and affecting.""

78,Pride & Prejudice,United Kingdom ,StudioCanal,United International Pictures,Keira Knightley Matthew Macfadyen Brenda Blethyn Donald Sutherland Tom Hollander Rosamund Pike Jena Malone Judi Dench,Deborah Moggach,127,Joe Wright,28000000,121600000,"Pride & Prejudice is a 2005 romantic drama film directed by Joe Wright, in his feature directorial debut, and based on Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same name. The film features five sisters from an English family of landed gentry as they deal with issues of marriage, morality and misconceptions. Keira Knightley stars in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, while Matthew Macfadyen plays her romantic interest Mr. Darcy. Produced by Working Title Films in association with StudioCanal, the film was released on 16 September 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 11 November in the United States.
Screenwriter Deborah Moggach initially attempted to make her script as faithful to the novel as possible, writing from Elizabeth's perspective while preserving much of the original dialogue. Wright, who was directing his first feature film, encouraged greater deviation from the text, including changing the dynamics within the Bennet family. Wright and Moggach set the film in an earlier period and avoided depicting a ""perfectly clean Regency world"", presenting instead a ""muddy hem version"" of the time. It was shot entirely on location in England on a 15-week schedule. Wright found casting difficult due to past performances of particular characters. The filmmakers had to balance who they thought was best for each role with the studio's desire for stars. Knightley was well known in part from her role in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, while Macfadyen had no international name recognition.
The film's themes emphasise realism, romanticism and family. It was marketed to a younger, mainstream audience; promotional items noted that it came from the producers of 2001's romantic comedy Bridget Jones's Diary before acknowledging its provenance as an Austen novel. Pride & Prejudice earned a worldwide gross of approximately $121 million, which was considered a commercial success. Pride & Prejudice earned a rating of 82% from review aggregator Metacritic, labelling it universally acclaimed. It received four nominations at the 78th Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Knightley. Austen scholars have opined that Wright's work created a new hybrid genre by blending traditional traits of the heritage film with ""youth-oriented filmmaking techniques"".","Section: Plot (1):
During the late 18th century, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their daughters – Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia – live at Longbourn, their estate in rural England. Mrs. Bennet, eager to secure her daughters' futures through suitable marriages, is delighted when wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley moves into nearby Netherfield. Bingley is introduced to local society at an assembly ball with his sister, Caroline, and his friend, Mr. Darcy. Bingley and Jane are taken with each other, while Elizabeth instantly dislikes the aloof Darcy and overhears his demeaning remarks about her.
Later visiting the Bingleys, Jane falls ill and must stay to recuperate. At Netherfield to see Jane, Elizabeth verbally spars with the haughty Caroline and Darcy. The Bennets are visited by Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, a pompous clergyman; as the Bennets have no sons, Collins will inherit Longbourn. Mr. Collins intends to propose to Jane, but Mrs. Bennet suggests Elizabeth instead. The Bennet sisters meet the charming Lieutenant Wickham, who is connected to the Darcy family and wins Elizabeth's sympathy by claiming Mr. Darcy denied him his rightful inheritance.
At a ball held at Netherfield, Elizabeth is pursued by Collins, and accepts Darcy's request for a dance, trading witty taunts with him. The next day, Collins proposes to Elizabeth, who declines; despite her mother's anger, her father supports her decision. When the Bingley party unexpectedly return to London, Elizabeth sends Jane to the city to stay with their aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, hoping to reconnect her with Bingley. Elizabeth is astonished that her friend Charlotte, fearing spinsterhood, has accepted Mr. Collins' proposal.
Months later, Elizabeth visits the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Collins, who reside on the manor estate of his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Invited to dine there, Elizabeth is surprised to see Darcy, who is Lady Catherine's nephew, visiting with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Unaware Jane is Elizabeth's sister, Fitzwilliam mentions that Darcy recently separated Bingley from a woman with an ""unsuitable"" family.
Distraught, Elizabeth is confronted by Darcy, who proposes marriage and declares he loves her ""most ardently"" despite her inferior rank. She refuses, and he defends his interference with Jane and Bingley, and criticizes the Bennet family. Elizabeth cites his treatment of Wickham, leaving Darcy angry and heartbroken. He leaves her a letter describing Wickham's true character: Wickham squandered the bequest Darcy's father left him, then attempted to seduce Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, into eloping to gain her fortune.
Elizabeth returns home, as does Jane, having moved on from Bingley. Accompanying the Gardiners on a trip to the Peak District, Elizabeth reluctantly tours Pemberley, the grand Darcy estate. She runs into Darcy, who invites her and the Gardiners to dine at Pemberley. Darcy's manner has softened considerably, and Georgiana shares her brother's flattering reports about Elizabeth.
An urgent letter from Jane reveals that Lydia has run off with Wickham. Darcy leaves abruptly, and Elizabeth returns home, where her mother fears Lydia's disgrace will ruin her sisters' chances for good marriages. Mr. Gardiner sends news that Lydia and Wickham are now married, and the newlyweds return to Longbourn. Lydia lets slip to Elizabeth that it was Darcy who found them, and paid for their wedding and Wickham's military commission.
Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield and visit Longbourn; Bingley proposes to Jane, who accepts. Late that night, Lady Catherine arrives to see Elizabeth, and demands she never become engaged to Darcy; deeply insulted, Elizabeth refuses and she demands that she leave her house for insulting her and her family. Walking the moor early the next morning, Elizabeth encounters Darcy, who apologizes for his aunt's intrusion. He professes his continued love, and Elizabeth, her feelings radically altered, accepts his proposal. She tells her father the truth of Darcy's actions, and Mr. Bennet gives Elizabeth his consent to marry, overjoyed she has found love.

Section: Conception and adaptation (2):
As with several recent Jane Austen adaptations, Pride & Prejudice was an Anglo-American collaboration, between British studio Working Title Films (in association with French company StudioCanal) and its American parent company Universal Studios. Working Title at the time was known for mainstream productions like Bridget Jones's Diary and Love Actually that drew international audiences, rather than films in the historical drama genre. Its co-chairman Tim Bevan explained that the studio wanted to ""bring Austen's original story, concentrating on Lizzie, back in all its glory to the big screen for audiences everywhere to enjoy"". Given a ""relatively inexpensive"" budget of £22 million ($28 million), the film was expected to excel at the box office, particularly based on the commercial successes of Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Shakespeare in Love (1998) as well as the resurgence of interest in Austen's works.

Given little instruction from the studio, screenwriter Deborah Moggach spent over two years adapting Pride and Prejudice for film. She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts. Realising it held ""a perfect three-act structure"", Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it ""so beautifully shaped as a story – the ultimate romance about two people who think they hate each other but who are really passionately in love. I felt, 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.'"" While she could not reproduce the novel's ""fiercely wonderful dialogue in its entirety"", she attempted to keep much of it.Moggach's first script was closest to Austen's book, but later versions trimmed extraneous storylines and characters. Moggach initially wrote all scenes from Elizabeth's point of view in keeping with the novel; she later set a few scenes from the male perspective, such as when Bingley practices his marriage proposal, to ""show Darcy and Bingley being close"" and to indicate Darcy was a ""human being instead of being stuck up"". Small details were inserted that acknowledged wider events outside of the characters' circle, such as those then occurring in France. While Moggach is the only screenwriter credited for the film, playwright Lee Hall also made early additions to the script.Television director Joe Wright was hired in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his feature film directorial debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who were looking for a fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, ""I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it"". He next read the novel, which he called ""an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people ... things like that.""

The only adaptation of Pride and Prejudice Wright had seen was the 1940 production, which was the last time the novel had been adapted into a feature film. The director purposely did not watch the other productions, both out of fear he would inadvertently steal ideas and because he wanted to be as original as possible. He did, however, watch other period films, including Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, Roger Michell's Persuasion, and John Schlesinger's Far from the Madding Crowd; Wright cited this last film as the greatest influence on his own adaptation, calling it ""very real and very honest – and it is quite romantic as well"". In trying to create an atmosphere of charged flirtation, the director also gained inspiration from teen romance films such as Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.Wright's hire occurred while Moggach was on her third draft. Despite her desire to work closely with Austen's dialogue, Wright made an effort to not ""be too reverential to [it]. I don't believe people spoke like that then; it's not natural."" While a few scenes, such as the discussion over accomplished women, aligned closely with the author's original dialogue, many others ""substituted instead a mixture of modern idiom and archaic-sounding sentence structure"". One alteration concerned politeness; Wright noted that while Austen's work had characters waiting before speaking, he believed that ""particularly in big families of girls, everyone tends to speak over each other, finishing each other's sentences, etc. So I felt that the Bennet family's conversations would be overlapping like that."" Sense and Sensibility actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson aided in script development, though she opted to be uncredited. She advised the nervous director about adapting Austen for the screen and made dialogue recommendations, such as with parts of the Collins-Charlotte storyline.Citing the year Austen first wrote a draft of the novel, Wright and Moggach changed the period setting from 1813 (the novel's publication date) to the late eighteenth century; this decision was partly because Wright wanted to highlight the differences within an England influenced by the French Revolution, as he was fascinated that it had ""caused an atmosphere among the British aristocracy of fear"". Additionally, Wright chose the earlier period because he hated dresses with an empire silhouette, which were popular in the later period. The decision helped make the film visually distinct from other recent Austen adaptations. In comparison to the popular 1995 BBC version, which featured Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, producer Paul Webster desired to make an adaptation that ""doesn't conform to the television drama stereotypes of a perfect clean Regency world"". Wright and Moggach opted for a ""muddy hem version"" of Longbourn, presenting a more rural setting than in previous adaptations out of a desire to depict the Bennets in ""very close proximity to their rural life"" and to emphasise their relative poverty. While the degree of poverty was criticised by some critics, Wright felt that the ""mess adds to the drama of the predicament that the family were in"", and helps contrast the Bennets, Darcys, and Bingleys.

Section: Casting (2):
Wright found casting of the film to be difficult because he was very particular about ""the types of people [he] wanted to work with"". While interviewing to direct, he insisted that the actors match the ages of the characters in the novel. Wright specifically cast actors that had rapport on and off screen, and insisted that they partake in three weeks of rehearsal in improvisation workshops. Wright also had to balance who he thought was best for each role with what the producers wanted – mainly a big name attraction. Though Wright had not initially pictured someone as attractive as English actress Keira Knightley for the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, he cast her after realising that the actress ""is really a tomboy [and] has a lively mind and a great sense of humour"". Knightley at the time was known for Bend It Like Beckham and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. She had been an Austen fan since age 7, but initially feared taking the role out of apprehension that she would be doing ""an absolute copy of Jennifer Ehle's performance"", which she deeply admired. Knightley believed Elizabeth is ""what you aspire to be: she's funny, she's witty and intelligent. She's a fully rounded and very much loved character."" For the period, the actress studied etiquette, history and dancing but ran into trouble when she acquired a short haircut while preparing for her role in the bounty hunter film Domino.

Webster found the casting of Darcy especially hard due to the character's iconic status and because ""Colin Firth cast a very long shadow"" as the 1995 Darcy. Wright later commented that his choice of Knightley allowed him to cast comparative unknown Matthew Macfadyen, something that would have been impossible had he chosen a less well-known actress for Elizabeth Bennet. Macfadyen at the time was known for his role in the British television spy series Spooks, but had no recognition internationally. A fan of the actor's television work, Wright called Macfadyen ""a proper manly man ... I didn't want a pretty boy kind of actor. His properties were the ones I felt I needed [for Darcy]. Matthew's a great big hunk of a guy.""According to Wright, Rosamund Pike was cast as the eldest sister ""because [he] knew she wasn't going to play her as a nice, simple person. Jane has a real interior world, she has her heart broken."" Despite being Pike's ex-boyfriend, Simon Woods was cast as her romantic interest Mr Bingley. The other three Bennet sisters were played by Talulah Riley, Carey Mulligan, and Jena Malone, the only American actress among them. Wright believed Malone to have a ""pretty faultless English accent"". Mulligan heard about the casting call at a dinner hosted by Julian Fellowes, to whom she had written a letter after failing to get into drama school; she won the part after three auditions. Tamzin Merchant appears as Georgiana Darcy; she was hired despite having no previous acting experience after she wrote a letter to the casting director. In addition to Merchant, Pride & Prejudice was the feature film debut of both Mulligan and Riley.Donald Sutherland reminded Wright of his own father and was cast as the Bennet patriarch; Wright thought the actor possessed the ""strength to handle those six women"". Brenda Blethyn was hired to play Mrs Bennet, whom Moggach believed to be the unsung heroine of the film; Wright explained that it was ""a tricky part [to fill], as she can be very annoying; you want to stop her chattering and shrieking. But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of love and care Mrs Bennet has for her daughters."" Wright convinced veteran actress Judi Dench to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read ""I love it when you play a bitch. Please come and be a bitch for me."" Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.

Section: Costume design (2):
Known for her BAFTA award-winning work on the 2004 film Vera Drake, Jacqueline Durran was hired as the costume designer. She and Wright approached his film ""as a difficult thing to tackle"" because of their desire to distinguish it from the television adaptation. Due to Wright's dislike of the high waistline, Durran focused on later eighteenth century fashions that often included a corseted, natural waistline rather than an empire silhouette (which became popular after the 1790s). A generational divide was established: the older characters dress in mid-eighteenth century fashions while the young wear ""a sort of proto-Regency style of hair and dress"".Durran's costumes also helped emphasise social rank among the different characters; Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then been at the height of fashion. During her interview, Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. Costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.To help differentiate the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the ""tomboy"", clothing her in earthy colours because of her love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, ""Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee in a kind of teenage way. I tried to make it so that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two."" In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses.
Mr Darcy's costume went through a series of phases. Durran noted: The first time we see him he's at Meriton  [sic], where he has a very stiffly tailored jacket on and he's quite contained and rigid. He stays in that rigid form for the first part of the film. By the time we get to the proposal that goes wrong in the rain, we move to a similar cut, but a much softer fabric. And then later he's got a completely different cut of coat, not interlined and he wears it undone. The nth degree is him walking through the mist in the morning, completely undressed by 18th-century standards. It's absolutely unlikely, but then Lizzie's in her nightie, so what can you say?

Section: Filming (2):
Moggach believed the novel was very filmable, ""despite it containing no description and being a very unvisual book"". To Wright, many other period films had relied on paintings for inspiration rather than photographs, causing them to appear unreal. He thus used ""Austen's prose [to give him] many visual references for the people in the story"", including using close-up shots of various characters. The filmmakers also changed several scenes to more romantic locales than those in the book. For instance, in the film, Darcy first proposes outdoors in a rainstorm at a building with neoclassical architecture; in the book, this scene takes place inside a parsonage. In the film, his second proposal occurs on the misty moors as dawn breaks; in the book, he and Elizabeth are walking down a country lane in broad daylight. Wright has acknowledged that ""there are a lot of period film clichés; some of them are in the film and some are not, but for me it was important to question them"".

During script development, the crew created a ""constant going back and forth between script and location"". The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that ""it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe [Wright]'s idea was to try to create a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment."" Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because ""nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century"", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.Production staff selected particularly grand-looking residences to better convey the wealth and power of certain characters. Locations included Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, the largest privately held country house in England with its spectacular rooms frescoed by Antonio Verrio. Chatsworth House is often believed to have been Austen's inspiration for the Darcy residence. Chatsworth and Wilton House in Salisbury stood in for Pemberley. After a search of various sites in England, the moated manor house Groombridge Place in Kent was chosen for Longbourn. Location manager Adam Richards believed Groombridge had an ""immense charm"" that was ""untouched by post-17th Century development"". Reflecting Wright's choice of realism, Groombridge's interior was designed to be ""shabby chic"". Representing Netherfield Park was the late-18th century site Basildon Park in Berkshire, leading it to close for seven weeks to allow time for filming. Burghley House in Cambridgeshire stood in for Rosings, while the adjacent town of Stamford served as Meryton. Other locations included Haddon Hall (for The Inn at Lambton), the Temple of Apollo and Palladian Bridge of Stourhead (for the Gardens of Rosings), Hunsford (for Collins' parsonage and church) and Peak District (for Elizabeth and the Gardiners' tour). The first dance scenes were shot on a set in a potato warehouse in Lincolnshire with the employment of local townspeople as extras; this was the only set the crew built that was not already in existence.

Section: Music (2):
Italian composer Dario Marianelli wrote the film score. The soundtrack is performed by the French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet accompanied by the English Chamber Orchestra.
The early piano sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven ""became a point of reference"" and ""starting point"" for the original score. Some pieces were inspired by the film's period, with the assumption that they could conceivably have been heard during that time and contained actual dance cues that were fitting for the late eighteenth century. Pieces that actors perform were composed first, before filming began.
The soundtrack ultimately contained seventeen instrumental tracks of music organised in a different way from the film.

Section: Editing (2):
In contrast to the five-hour BBC adaptation, Wright compressed his film into two hours and nine minutes of screen time. He remarked that the film is ""obviously about Elizabeth and Darcy, following them and anything that detracts or diverts you from that story is what you have to cut"". Some of the most notable changes from the original book include time compression of several major sequences, including the departure of Wickham and the militia, Elizabeth's visit to Rosings Park and Hunsford Parsonage, Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley, Lydia's elopement and subsequent crisis; the elimination of several supporting characters, including Mr and Mrs Hurst, Mr and Mrs Phillips, Lady and Maria Lucas, Mrs Younge, several of Lydia's friends (including Colonel and Mrs Forster) and various military officers and townspeople; and the elimination of several sections in which characters reflect or converse on events that have recently occurred—for example, Elizabeth's chapter-long change of mind after reading Darcy's letter.
Moggach and Wright debated how to end the film, but knew they did not want to have a wedding scene ""because we didn't want Elizabeth to come off as the girl who became a queen at this lavish wedding, or for it to be corny"". Shortly before the North American release, the film was modified to include a final scene (not in the novel) of the married Darcys enjoying a romantic evening and passionate kiss at Pemberley in an attempt to attract sentimental viewers; this became a source of complaint for the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA). After watching a preview of the film before its wide release, former JASNA president Elsa Solender commented, ""It has nothing at all of Jane Austen in it, is inconsistent with the first two-thirds of the film, insults the audience with its banality and ought to be cut before release"". It had been removed from the British version after preview audiences found it unintentionally humorous; however, later audiences complained that they were excluded from viewing this version, causing the film to be re-released in the UK and Ireland 10 weeks after the original UK premiere date. The original British version ended with Mr Bennet's blessing upon Elizabeth and Darcy's union, thus circumventing the last chapter in the novel, which summarises the lives of the Darcys and the other main characters over the next several years.

","Section: Reception (1):
Pride & Prejudice was only the second film version after ""the famed, but oddly flawed, black-and-white 1940 adaptation, starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier"", and until 2005, The Times considered the 1995 television adaptation ""so dominant, so universally adored, [that] it has lingered in the public consciousness as a cinematic standard."" Wright's film consequently met with some scepticism from admirers of Austen, especially in relation to plot changes and casting choices. ""Any resemblance to scenes and characters created by Miss Austen is, of course, entirely coincidental,"" mocked The New Yorker's film critic. Given Austen's characters were landed gentry, especially criticised was the re-imagining of the Bennetts as country bumpkins, lacking even the basics of table manners, and their home ""a barnyard"".Comparing six major adaptations of Pride and Prejudice in 2005, The Daily Mirror gave the only top marks of 9 out of 10 to the 1995 serial and the 2005 film, leaving the other adaptations behind with six or fewer points. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a ""certified fresh"" approval rating of 86% based on reviews from 181 critics, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Sure, it's another adaptation of cinema's fave Jane Austen novel, but key performances and a modern filmmaking sensibility make this familiar period piece fresh and enjoyable."" On Metacritic the film has an average score of 82 out of 100, based on 37 reviews, indicating the film received ""universal acclaim"".  Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F.Critics claimed the film's time constraints did not capture the depth and complexity of the television serials and called Wright's adaptation ""obviously [not as] daring or revisionist"" as the serial. JASNA president Joan Klingel Ray preferred the young age of Knightley and Macfadyen, saying that Jennifer Ehle had formerly been ""a little too 'heavy' for the role."" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, while praising Knightley for an outstanding performance ""which lifts the whole movie"", considered the casting of the leads ""arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle."" He does add that ""Only a snob, a curmudgeon, or someone with necrophiliac loyalty to the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle could fail to enjoy [Knightley's] performance."" At the time, BBC film critic Stella Papamichael considered it Knightley's ""best performance yet."" However, The Daily Telegraph critic thought Knightley's acting skills slight, in her view, ""Someone who radiates little more than good-mannered perkiness"", and that between her and Macfadyen there was ""little spark"".Critics were divided about Macfadyen's portrayal of Darcy, expressing pleasant surprise, dislike for his lack of gradual emotional shift as in the novel, and praise for his matching the insecure and sensitive personality of the book character better than Firth.Critics also drew attention to other aspects of the film. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandra Hall criticised Wright's attention to realism for being ""careless with the customs and conventions that were part of the fabric of Austen's world."" In another review, Time Out magazine lamented the absence of Austen's ""brilliant sense of irony"", remarking that the film's ""romantic melodrama's played up at the expense of her razor-sharp wit."" More positively, Derek Elley of Variety magazine praised Wright and Moggach for ""extracting the youthful essence"" of the novel while also ""providing a richly detailed setting"" under Greenwood and Durran's supervision. Equally pleased with the film was the San Francisco Chronicle's Ruthe Stein, who wrote that Wright made a ""spectacular feature film debut"" that is ""creatively reimagined and sublimely entertaining"". Claudia Puig of USA Today called it ""a stellar adaptation, bewitching the viewer completely and incandescently with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit.""

Checco was born into a life of relative comfort and privilege among his peers in his small town in southern Italy. He is one of the lucky few to have a posto fisso, or guaranteed job as a public servant. When a new reformist government vows to cut down on bureaucracy, Checco is forced to accept ever-worsening public-sector postings in order to maintain his guaranteed pay, benefits, and lifetime employment. Dr. Sironi, a representative of the new government, is tasked with downsizing the public sector by offering buyouts to targeted government employees in exchange for their resignation (see constructive dismissal). She takes a special interest in Checco who eventually becomes the last resilient holdout; no matter what hellish place he is appointed to, he finds rays of hope and won't surrender his public employee status.
In a final attempt to erode his willpower, Sironi appoints him to the Italian arctic research station as a hunter to protect the team. Checco initially wants to resign, but changes his decision when he falls in love with Valeria, a coworker. During vacation Checco, visits Valeria where she lives in Norway and finds out that she has three children. He is also introduced to a whole new way of life. He becomes enchanted with the politeness and the aspects of progressive, eco-centric society.

The film stars Johannes Kuhnke, Nanna Blondell, Anastasios Soulis, Kalled Mustonen and Tomas Bergström. It  premiered on Netflix on February 11, 2021.","Section: Plot (1):
After his university graduation ceremony, David (Anastasios Soulis) publicly and awkwardly proposes to his girlfriend, Nadja (Nanna Blondell), which she happily accepts. A year and a half later, however, they are stressed due to work and school and fight frequently in their apartment in Stockholm. The stress is compounded when Nadja learns that she is pregnant, which she is unhappy about as she is studying to be a doctor and she is not sure if she and David should be parents. She decides to keep it a secret from David. Nadja opens up to an older neighbor, Thomas, and he assures her that she and David will be great parents; he insists that parenthood is life's greatest gifts and implies he has lost a child of his own. The next morning, David surprises Nadja with a camping trip to see the northern lights, and the two reconcile and take the trip with their dog, Boris. While stopping for gas, David encounters two locals, brothers Jarmo and Rolle, and is made uncomfortable by their rough mannerisms and their truck bed full of dead game. As he has difficulties taking his car out of park, he accidentally bumps into the brothers' truck, leaving scratches. David chooses to drive off instead of saying something, which annoys Nadja. When they reach their destination at an inn, the woman at the front desk treats them strangely and silently refuses to serve them, leaving her brother Einar to imply that she's not used to seeing an interracial couple. He learns of their itinerary and offers to host them at his cabin in the wilderness. Nadja becomes nervous seeing Jarmo and Rolle in the establishment, and when they leave, they discover that someone has keyed their car and vandalized their bumper sticker with a racial epithet. Angered by this, Nadja spots their pickup truck later on the drive and scratches it with a screwdriver, narrowly avoiding retaliation when the brothers catch her in the act. 
The couple camps beneath the northern lights, and Nadja reveals she is pregnant, which makes David nervous and unsure. Their conversation is interrupted when they spot a red dot on the wall of their tent. They first assume that it is a laser pointer prank, but quickly realize that is a laser sight from a rifle and guess that the brothers are attacking them in revenge for the car damage. Boris escapes into the wilderness while they try to hide, and they hear gunshots and the sound of Boris whining. After they are shot at, they flee into the forest and hear their pursuers chase after them. After spending the night hiding in a small shelter, they return to the bloodied campsite and find all their belongings missing, and Boris's decapitated head in the tent. While searching for any remaining possessions, David is injured when his arm gets caught in a hunting trap. Finding nothing to help them, they set off to find help. However, they are soon shot at again, and David, increasingly losing blood, hallucinates a boy in a winter coat staring at them. David is shot in the shoulder while Nadja escapes unhurt, and the two search for each other as a snowstorm sets in. Nadja realizes that she has run atop a frozen lake, and as David searches for her, he falls in and is narrowly rescued by her. The couple finally makes it to an emergency cabin, where they phone rescuers and are told they will have to wait until the storm passes for help.
The next morning, they hear a vehicle approach the cabin and realize it is an armed (but unaware) Jarmo, who works as a mountain rescuer. Escaping through a back window, they flee into the woods and seek shelter in what is revealed to be the den of a hibernating bear. Jarmo discovers them, but before he can shoot, Nadja shoots him with a flare found at the cabin. David's condition deteriorates as they progress, and he hallucinates the boy again and begins mumbling about guilt. Spotting Einar's cabin in the distance, Nadja runs ahead to get help for David, but encounters Rolle on the way. Rolle seems confused by her appearance, but before he can act, David knocks him unconscious with a rock, and the two make it to Einar's cabin. Einar appears to call for help, but Nadja realizes that he is contacting someone else, and Einar suddenly becomes aggressive and locks them in a room discovered to be covered in stealth photographs taken of the couple.
Finally, Thomas arrives with a rifle, and the truth is revealed: the day of the couple's engagement, Nadja attempted to perform oral sex on David as they drove home, and a distracted David struck and killed a pedestrian -- the boy he had hallucinated earlier, who was also Thomas's son and Einar's nephew. David chose to drive off instead of calling the police as Nadja wanted, which left her wracked with guilt. On that day, Thomas had been playing with a drone with his son, which had caused him to run into the road; however, the drone also captured the couple's license plate, and a grieving Thomas tracked them down and moved into a nearby apartment to surveil them. Thomas is intent on inflicting revenge on the couple for callously driving away, and had been behind the earlier murder attempts. He now decides to become more sadistic and tries to get David to use a power drill to torture and kill Nadja's child, and he shoots David in the knee when he does not comply. Thomas prepares to kill them both but is interrupted by the arrival of a furious Jarmo, who has tracked down the couple. In the confusion, Thomas shoots and fatally wounds Jarmo, who accidentally does the same to Einar, and Nadja and David escape while Jarmo and Thomas struggle for a rifle.
Nadja and David attempt to flee, but David cannot escape with his injuries. He tells Nadja to run, and when she stumbles upon the unconscious Rolle, she decides to take his rifle and save David. However, when she returns, she hesitates while trying to shoot him and is shot in the head and killed instantly by Mona, Thomas's wife and Einar's sister encountered earlier at the inn. A traumatized David begs to be killed as well, but Thomas refuses, telling him that he can now understand how he felt after his own son had died. Mona and Thomas depart as a dying David is left sobbing in the snow.

","Red Dot, Netflix’s first Swedish original feature-film, is darker, gorier, and generally more misanthropic than most Netflix genre fare. A spiraling and unyielding descent into a frozen hellscape of the protagonists’ own design, Red Dot’s high-concept, high-yield premise– namely, a couple on a camping retreat are awoken by the sight of a red laser dot in their tent– makes for a blisteringly frightening 80-minute ride. Almost Faustian in nature, Nadja (Nanna Blondell) and Einar (Johannes Kuhnke) are purveyors of their own suffering– in asking for too much, they’re posed to meet their ends.

The requisite backstory is streamlined and unfussy. Nadja and Einar are in love. He proposes to her in the kind of cutesy-comic scenario that is undoubtedly more charming on the page than on the screen (here, it’s accidentally over the loudspeaker at their favorite restaurant) and all seems right with the couple. They’re young, attractive, and Nadja’s race (she’s a black woman dating a white man) is narratively present without being terribly pronounced. It’s Sweden in the 21st century, and these yuppies are going to make it.Director Alain Daborg along with co-writer Per Dickson are quick to immolate the honeymoon period, however, casting their puppy-love atop a burning effigy of human resentment and incompatibility. They’re soon fighting all the time, awkwardly ambling about their shared space, leaving trails of contempt over every broken washing machine or dirty pile of laundry. Worse still, Nadja is pregnant, a critical tidbit she reveals only to neighbor Tomas (Thomas Hanzon). She doesn’t know if she will make a good mother. She doesn’t know if she wants to keep the baby.

Like trees lining the perimeter of Kiruna’s frozen tundra, the fractured, harsh landscape of their relationship is known– it is virulent and strained. Either aloof or simply blockish, Einar suggests he and Nadja spend the weekend far away camping under the Northern Lights, just the two of them. Nadja, despite the morning sickness that Einar is painfully unaware of (she stops the car several times to vomit and Einar never questions why that might be), reluctantly agrees. The tension that lived in shadows and corners before becomes more pronounced the closer they get to their destination. Einar hits another traveler’s car at the gas station and several locals scrawl racial epithets on their car. The innkeeper, too, is uncomfortably curious about their sex life, urging them to make passionate love to one another under the Aurora Borealis.

The first night they’re out under the pinks, greens, and purples delicately dancing in the sky above, the red dot appears. At first innocuous– Nadja reasons, in conventional horror fashion, that it must be kids– the bullets soon start flying, and without supplies or appropriate gear, Nadja and Einar flee into the nearby woods, thus beginning their relentless cat-and-mouse game with an unknown pursuer.

Domestic discontent fuels most of the first act. Red Dot has less than an hour left to go when the titular dot makes it first appearance. Director Daborg wisely knows the inherent limits of his premise, ensuring the ensuing action never overstay its welcome or plummet into tedium– there is only so much subversion to be found in chasing a young couple through the woods. In lieu of innovation, Daborg channels his inner sadist, rendering Red Dot what will likely be one of 2021’s most dour and discouraging experiences. The violence soon comes hard and fast as dogs are beheaded, skin is flayed, and bones are crushed. Regarding that first note in particular, dog lovers are warned.

Early indications that racism or cultural discontent are soon discarded– this isn’t a random or politically-motivated attack. Instead, Nadja and Einar are being targeted for something considerably darker and more personal. Skeletons in the closet manifest in increasingly disturbing ways, culminating in torture-porn-tinged finale that will make even the most resolute of genre fans turn away.  

Red Dot is a perfect fit for Netflix’s burgeoning interest in financing, producing, and distributing international genre titles. Recent titles like Spain’s Don’t Listen and South Korea’s The Call are compelling, nuanced watches, the kind of titles that belie easy categorization, thereby making them ideal additions to Netflix’s unique library. There, these hard-to-sell movies stand a chance. For fans of hard and fast survival thrills, Red Dot is certain to satisfy. Adrenaline-fueled and sufficiently vicious, the red dot is on target– and the target is a good one.",5.5,9764," Drama, Horror, Thriller",Positive,0.72
81,Rocketman,United Kingdom ,New Republic Pictures ,Paramount Pictures,Taron Egerton Jamie Bell Richard Madden Bryce Dallas Howard,Lee Hall,121,Dexter Fletcher,40000000,195200000,"Rocketman is a 2019 biographical musical film based on the life of British musician Elton John. Directed by Dexter Fletcher and written by Lee Hall, it stars Taron Egerton as Elton John, with Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin, Richard Madden as John Reid, and Bryce Dallas Howard as Sheila Eileen, John's mother. The film follows John in his early days in England as a prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music through his musical partnership with Taupin, and is titled after John's 1972 song ""Rocket Man"".
The film had been in development since the 2000s before it was announced in 2013 that Focus Features acquired the rights to the film and director Michael Gracey and actor Tom Hardy were set to direct and star in the project respectively. After Hardy and Gracey left the project following creative differences between Focus and John that halted an initial production start in fall 2014, the project languished for several years until Paramount Pictures and New Republic Pictures took over as distributor in April 2018, where Egerton and Fletcher signed on. Principal photography began in August 2018 and was completed later that year. John served as executive producer, while his husband David Furnish produced the film through their Rocket Pictures, alongside Matthew Vaughn's Marv Films.
Rocketman premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2019, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2019 and in the United States on 31 May 2019. It grossed $195 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Egerton's performance, the costume design and musical numbers. The film was the first by a major studio to include a gay male sex scene. For his performance, Egerton received numerous nominations, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. John and Taupin also won Best Original Song at the 77th Golden Globe Awards, Best Song at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, and Best Original Song at the 92nd Academy Awards for ""(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again"", and earned four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, including Outstanding British Film.","Section: Plot (1):
Dressed in a flamboyant devil's outfit, Elton John enters an addiction rehabilitation session, recounting his life in a flashback (""The Bitch Is Back"").
Reginald Dwight grows up in 1950s Britain, raised by his unaffectionate mother, Sheila, and more loving grandmother Ivy. Reginald is interested in music and hopes to perform for his father, Stanley, who takes no interest in his son (""I Want Love"").
Reginald begins piano lessons, making his way into the Royal Academy of Music. Stanley abandons his family after Sheila has an affair. Reginald develops an interest in rock music and performs in local pubs (""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting""). As an adult, Reginald joins the band Bluesology, which is hired to play backup for touring American bands, The Isley Brothers and Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles (""Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache""). Isley Brothers lead singer Ronald Isley recommends Reginald write songs and put his old life behind him to become a famous artist. Reginald changes his name to Elton John, Elton being the name of the saxophonist of Bluesology, and John being adopted from Long John Baldry.
Elton writes music and tries to find success with Dick James' record label DJM Records under the management of Ray Williams. Williams introduces Elton to lyricist Bernie Taupin; they become friends and move into a flat to compose their songs (""Border Song""). When Elton admits he is homosexual, he ends his romantic relationship with their landlady, and he and Bernie are evicted.
Elton and Bernie move in with Elton's grandmother, his mother, and her boyfriend, where they continue writing and create ""Your Song"". James sets up a performance for them at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Elton is nervous before his debut, but the audience embraces his performance (""Crocodile Rock""). Elton is overjoyed by his success but feels abandoned when Bernie leaves him at a party to spend time with a woman (""Tiny Dancer""). He is approached by John Reid, a music manager. They sleep together and later reunite.
Reid's influence over Elton launches a downward spiral into a life of debauchery while his career rises to new heights (""Honky Cat""). Elton develops a flamboyant stage persona and becomes one of the most successful artists of the 1970s. Reid's manipulation escalates to abuse after he becomes Elton's manager. Reid insists Elton comes out to his parents as gay, so Elton reconnects with his father, who has a new family but still displays no interest in Elton. Distraught, Elton calls his mother and tells her he is gay. She tells him that she already knew, but that he will be forever unloved. Struggling with parental issues as well as Reid's increasing physical and emotional abuse, Elton becomes addicted to alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, shopping, and sex to escape his pain and loneliness, but his mood swings and short temper alienate his friends (""Pinball Wizard"").
Elton catches Reid cheating on him and breaks off their relationship, but Reid continues as his manager. During a party, he binges on drugs and alcohol and attempts suicide by jumping into his pool. He is rushed to the hospital, then thrust on stage at Dodger Stadium to perform (""Rocket Man"").
Elton descends further into a life of drugs, alcohol, and loneliness (""Bennie and the Jets""). He has a short-lived marriage with a close female friend, Renate Blauel, but his homosexuality dooms their relationship (""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me""). He falls out with his mother and Bernie (""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word""). Elton's dependence on prescription pills and alcohol result in a heart attack. Realizing his life is out of control, Elton seeks help (""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""). He enters rehab and realizes he no longer needs support from his parents or Reid. Elton rekindles his friendship with Bernie, who brings him new lyrics. Elton is worried that he cannot perform or compose without alcohol or drugs, but writes ""I'm Still Standing"" and returns to a successful career.
The epilogue notes that Elton has been sober for over twenty-eight years, but ""still has issues with shopping"". He remains good friends with Bernie and is married to David Furnish, with whom he has two children, and is finally loved properly.

Elton John and husband David Furnish tried to produce a film based on his life for almost two decades. The earliest efforts dated back to the 2000s, when development started at Walt Disney Pictures. Photographer David LaChapelle was set to direct the film after his work on the video for John's 2001 single, ""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore"", which featured Justin Timberlake as a young John. However, the project languished for nearly two decades. In an article written for The Guardian, John said that he struggled to get the film off the ground due to studios wanting it to be toned down to a PG-13 rating instead of an R.In January 2012, John announced that he had named Timberlake as his top choice to play him in the film. Lee Hall was set to pen the screenplay. In March 2013, Michael Gracey was hired to direct, with Tom Hardy cast in October to play John and Focus Features acquiring the U.S. distribution rights. Filming was initially planned to start in autumn 2014. However, creative differences between John and Focus, along with budget issues, led him and Furnish to take the project elsewhere.In July 2017, it was announced that Hardy was no longer involved, and Taron Egerton entered negotiations to replace him. While editing Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Matthew Vaughn learned about the project and took interest in producing the film on the condition that Egerton played John. Vaughn then picked Dexter Fletcher, who had replaced Bryan Singer during the production of the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, to direct the film since Gracey was busy with The Greatest Showman and was later credited as one of the executive producers on the film. The producers then filmed a sequence of Egerton as John performing two of John's songs, and presented it to Jim Gianopulos, who had worked with Vaughn on the Kingsman franchise at 20th Century Fox and was now the CEO of Paramount Pictures. Paramount and New Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film in exchange for worldwide distribution rights. It was reported that Egerton would sing the songs in the film himself, produced by Giles Martin, who was brought on as music producer for the project. In an interview at CinemaCon, Egerton stated the film would be a lot more of a stylized epic musical-fantasy rather than just a traditional straightforward biopic.

It was released on 5 September 2008 in the United Kingdom, hitting number one in the UK box office in its first week of release. Over the years, the film has gained a cult following.","Section: Plot (1):
In London, mob boss Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) rules the ever-growing real estate business, using a corrupt Councillor (Jimi Mistry) for bureaucratic fixing, and his right-hand man Archy (Mark Strong) for the dirty side of things. A billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich (Karel Roden), plans a fixed land deal, and London's crooks seem to all want a piece of it — particularly Uri's underhanded accountant Stella (Thandie Newton), and a gang called ""The Wild Bunch"" led by small-time crook ""One-Two"" (Gerard Butler), his partner ""Mumbles"" (Idris Elba), and their driver, ""Handsome Bob"" (Tom Hardy).
Uri agrees to Lenny's price of €7,000,000 to grease the council's wheels, and as a sign of trust, Uri loans Lenny his ""lucky painting."" Yet when Uri arranges for Stella to move the funds, she double-crosses him and hires the Wild Bunch to steal the money. Unfortunately for Lenny, however, his junkie stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), supposedly dead, steals the painting from Lenny's wall. Lenny and Archy then coerce Johnny's American managers Mickey (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Jeremy Piven) into tracking down Johnny. In a subplot, Handsome Bob gets close to Stella's gay husband, a lawyer who has information on a longtime unknown informer in their criminal circle whose information has Bob looking at a five-year prison term.
Uri tasks Stella once more with covertly siphoning the necessary payoff from his holdings, and grows increasingly enamoured with her. When his moneymen are once again robbed by the Wild Bunch, his assistant Victor convinces him that it's likely Lenny who is behind the robberies, and is also purposely keeping Uri's lucky painting from him. Uri & Victor then invite Lenny to a private golf game on a golf course owned by Uri, where Victor beats him savagely with a golf club, finishing by breaking Lenny's leg as a warning to him.
Cookie (Matt King) happens to buy the painting from some crackheads who had just stolen it from Johnny's hideout. Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who, in turn, offers the painting to Stella (after a sexual encounter) as a token of appreciation. After Stella leaves his flat, One-Two is surprised by Uri's henchmen but is rescued, and then kidnapped, by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri's money.
Uri wants to marry Stella, whom he has long admired. He goes to Stella's house to propose, but he then spots the painting. Stella lies and says she has had it for years. Uri, enraged by Stella's betrayal, orders Victor to kill her.
Archy brings Johnny, Roman, Mickey and the Wild Bunch to Lenny's warehouse where Lenny orders Johnny executed. He threatens to kill the Wild Bunch ""very slowly"" unless they give up the money they stole. Handsome Bob offers the legal documents concerning the informant in his pocket to Archy. Archy recognises the pseudonym used on the documents, ""Sidney Shaw"", as belonging to Lenny. Lenny arranged the police to routinely lock up many criminal associates (including Archy) for years at a time to enhance his own standing in the criminal underworld and to ensure his own freedom. Archy orders Lenny's men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny drowned and fed to crayfish.
In the lift, Johnny explains to Roman and Mickey that they will also be killed to leave no witnesses, and graphically explains the manner of their executions. His description unnerves the man who's to execute the three men, prompting him to act prematurely. Having also already anticipated this move, Johnny warns Mickey and Roman to intervene and kill their would-be executioner. Johnny shoots two more men waiting at the top of the lift and they escape the last of Archy's men (with help from One-Two and the Wild Bunch).
Later, Archy picks up Johnny from rehab and gives Johnny Uri's lucky painting as a welcome home present. Archy says that obtaining the painting ""cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg"" implying he had Uri killed. Johnny proclaims that, with his new-found freedom from addiction and from his stepfather, he will do what he could not before: ""become a real RocknRolla"".
The film ends with the title card stating, ""Johnny, Archy and the Wild Bunch will be back in The Real RocknRolla.""

Critical reaction to the film has been mixed, with a 60% rating out of 147 reviews on the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.98/10. The critical consensus states: ""Mixed reviews for Guy Ritchie's return to his London-based cockney wideboy gangster movie roots, but most agree, it's a step in the right direction following two major turkeys."" The website Metacritic, which compiles and then aggregates major film critics' reviews, gave the film a 53 out of 100, which is categorised as having mixed or average reviews. While the film's unoriginal themes were criticised, the script and direction, as well as the performances of Strong, Butler and Kebbell, were praised.
IGN gave the film a positive review with four out of five stars, saying ""[Guy Ritchie is] hardly re-inventing the wheel with this movie, but RocknRolla is nonetheless a comedy thriller that is every bit as accomplished as his early work, and without doubt a witty, adrenaline-fuelled blast from start to finish."" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, stating that ""It never slows down enough to be really good, and never speeds up enough to be the Bourne Mortgage Crisis, but there's one thing for sure: British actors love playing gangsters as much as American actors love playing cowboys, and it's always nice to see people having fun.""

In Old Latium in 753 BC, a flash flood causes the two shepherd brothers Romulus and Remus to be stranded and captured as slaves in Alba Longa. They are able to rebel and free the other Latin and Sabine prisoners and take the Vesta priestess Satnei, who carries with her the sacred fire, as hostage. In a conflict concerning the injured Romulus, Remus ends up killing the Latin leader and becomes the new leader of the tribe.
The group face and defeat a warrior clan and Remus is appointed king by the surviving old men and women of their pagus. During a sacrifice, Satnei predicts that one of the two brothers will become a great king and build an empire larger than what can be imagined, but to do so he will have to kill the other brother. The tribe assume that the prophecy means that Romulus will end up dead for the sake of his brother's greatness.
Remus refuses to accept a divine order that requires him to kill his brother. He extinguishes the sacred fire of Vesta, kills an old priest and leaves Satnei helpless in the middle of a forest. Returning to the pagus, Remus degrades all the inhabitants into slaves. Romulus regains his health and confronts Remus about his actions. Remus, regretful, goes to find Satnei, who while dying from having been attacked by wild animals tells him that sparing Romulus now means that it is Remus who will end up dead at the hands of Romulus.
Romulus is able to rekindle the sacred fire and becomes the new leader of the pagus. He appoints a young woman to watch over the fire so it remains lit, thereby establishing the first Vestal. Remus, trying to escape the prophecy, heads for the Tiber with a group of men, but is attacked by Alban cavalry and only saved by the tribe of Romulus. Remus then claims the tribe for himself, and threatening to extinguish the sacred flame is confronted by his brother. Remus induces his brother to kill him so that the prophecy can be fulfilled. On his deathbed he makes peace with his brother, recognizes him as his king, and tells him to establish a city on the other side of the river.
The tribe cross the Tiber and burn Remus' body on a pyre. Romulus swears to build the world's largest and most powerful city on his brother's ashes. He gives the city the name of Rome.
During the end credits, an animated map shows the expansion of the territory subject to Rome up to its peak under the emperor Trajan in 117.

The idea to make the film in archaic Latin came from a desire to make the characters sound ancestral, which would help the audience to attune themselves to the story. The language was created by a team from the Sapienza University of Rome led by professor Donatella Gentili. The team studied archaic Latin and ""fleshed it out"" with help from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language.Two visual influences were the films Valhalla Rising (2009) and Apocalypto (2006).

","Matteo Rovere's Romulus & Remus - The First King [+],in Italian cinemas from 31 January with 01 Distribution, has been hotly anticipated after successfully traversing the somewhat stifling Italian film market. Rovere is well-known for his 2016 film, Italian Race [+], as well as his ambition to combine genre with work as an auteur, supplying the viewer with the right mix of action and style in an attempt to create an alternative cinema model – one that’s based on the construction of financial plans. An Italian-Belgium €9,000,000 co-production (Groenlandia and GapBusterswith RAI Cinema, in association with Roman Citizen Entertainment), Romulus & Remus - The First King is about the founding of Rome and focuses on the relationship of two twin brothers, Romulus (Alessio Lapice) and Remus (Alessandro Borghi), with legend having it that the former went on to found the greatest empire history has ever known. The film focuses on two simple shepherds who are overwhelmed when the river Tiber floods. Viewers will immediately pick up on the brothers’ very close and protective bond. Taken prisoner in order to be sacrificed to a ""triple goddess,"" together with some other slaves, they escape, taking with them the vestal Satnei (Tania Garribba), who guards the sacred fire. Through marshes and woodlands, in an archetypal journey created by Christopher Vogler, the small group moves towards freedom, pursued by soldiers from Alba Longa, the powerful city of the Latin people. Remus is seriously injured during an ambush, but his brother fights off both men and gods to save him, unaware of his fate. 

In addition to the film’s set design, with its attempt at historical reconstruction (the film is set in 800 B.C.) based on valid scientific sources, the director and production team have attempted to engage in a philological operation very similar to Mel Gibson’s successful attemptin Passion of Christ –which is in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin – and Apocalypto, which is in the Yucatec Maya language. In fact, the cast of The First King speaks a proto-Italic language, reconstructed by a group of semiologists thanks to epigraphs, tombs and objects that were contemporary to the time period in which Romulus and Remus were imagined to have lived. A courageous and exciting decision that will be put to the test at the cinema, but which doesn’t seem to compromise narration and makes for an immersive experience. The action scenes are very elaborate, and the fight scenes, in particular, are raw, animalistic and somewhat reminiscent of Vikings, Game of Thrones or even Valhalla Rising [+]. 

But the most interesting aspect of the screenplay lies in the fact that Remus is given both a body and an identity, seeing as he has always historically (or rather legendarily) been known as a failure. It is no coincidence that the role has been entrusted to Alessandro Borghi, a promising actor in recent years – winner of the European Shooting Star Award at the Berlinale in 2017, and superb protagonist of Don't Be Bad [+], Suburra [+] and On My Skin [+]. In fact, Remus is the film’s true protagonist. And in this ""double"" game, he immediately proves to be the most charismatic and vigorous of the twins. Slowly, he begins to convince himself that he is the chosen one and that he can be king, embodying the classic sin of hubris. His challenge to the gods, in a society in which everything humans do is subject to divine judgment, makes him very ""modern,"" for better or for worse. But ""a God that can be understood is no God,"" as we read in the film – a William Somerset Maugham quote– and Remus will pay for his arrogance. Romulus’ religious feelings and understanding of the weak will inevitably triumph, as per various historical sources. Moreover, the word ""asylum,"" which is much debated today, can be owed to the legend of Romulus: founder of a new city that guaranteed shelter and protection to all.",6.5,4717," Drama, History",Positive,0.995

It was released on Netflix on 9 December 2020.,"Section: Plot (1):
Giorgio Rosa approaches the Council of Europe with a petition to protect and recognize his Island, which he later elaborates was built by him and his friend Maurizio Orlandini. The film flashes back a year to show how that after passing the state engineering exam, he met with his ex-girlfriend, Gabriella, in Bologna. He offers to drive her home and they are stopped by the police in his self made car, which has no licence plate and hasn't been registered. He is jailed for the night and bailed out by his father. 
Three months later, he is working for motorbike racer Bruno Spaggiari as an engineer when he sees a billboard showing an oil platform. Inspired, he convinces Maurizio who is tired of working in his father's company, to help him build an island just outside the territorial waters and legal jurisdiction of Italy, where everyone is free to do as they want. With money that Maurizio has stolen from his father and innovative solutions to reduce the cost of the materials, they are successful in building an island of their own with a supply of fresh water. A cast-away welder with his boat asks for shelter during a storm and becomes the first resident. 
Club promoter Wolfgang Rudy Neumann, a stateless past-German who is a PR manager for a beach club, visits the island. He starts to promote the island as a tourist destination and more people begin to visit, attracted by the freedom it represents from the established states. Franca, a 19 year old pregnant girl offers to become the barmaid of the 400 square metre island's sole bar. Gabriella, who had come to the island to tell Giorgio of her pending marriage, claims that it's not a nation, and is nothing more than a disco. Giorgio argues that the island, now named Rose Island, has its own language, currency, postal system and other amenities including a citizenship process that is soon to be started. Gabriella points out that there is no official recognition of it.
A letter is then written to the United Nations Headquarters in New York, who contact the Italian government. Giorgio, who has been named the island's president, is pressured by the government to relinquish control. He refuses, and in retaliation the authorities arrange for his father to be fired from his job. Other members of the island are also made offers to leave, which they accept. Gabriella advises Giorgio to approach the Council of Europe to help him, and they accept his case for further investigation. The Italian government threatens to destroy the island. When Giorgio refuses to back down, the other residents return and stand along with him on the island against the Italian navy. They are detained and the island is blown up. The film ends showing Gabriella and Giorgio getting back together. History notes that Rose Island was, despite its short life, a landmark event of being the only nation to be directly attacked by the Italian Republic. To prevent similar accidents to happen in the future, however, the UN extends the international waters territory from 6 to 12 nautical miles.

85,Scarface,United States,Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures,Al Pacino,Oliver Stone,169,Brian De Palma,25000000,65884703,"Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. A remake of the 1932 film of the same name, it tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino), who arrives penniless in 1980s Miami but would go on to become a powerful drug lord. The film co-stars Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia. De Palma dedicated this version of Scarface to the writers of the original film, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht.Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983, in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder.
Scarface premiered in New York City on December 1, 1983, and was released on December 9, 1983, by Universal Pictures. The film grossed $45 million at the domestic box office and $66 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to its excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever made. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music, as well as comic books, television programs, and video games, although over the years, the film has been regarded as a cult film.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1980, Cuban refugee and ex-convict Tony Montana arrives in Miami, Florida, as part of the Mariel boatlift, where he is sent to a refugee camp with friends Manny Ray, Angel, and Chi Chi. The four are released and given green cards in exchange for murdering a former Cuban general at the request of Miami drug lord Frank Lopez. They become dishwashers at an eatery, but a dissatisfied Tony proclaims that he is meant for bigger things.
Frank's right-hand man, Omar, sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers, but the deal goes badly. Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, while Manny and Chi Chi rescue Tony and kill the Colombians. Suspecting that Omar set them up, Tony and Manny insist on personally delivering the recovered drugs and money to Frank. During their meeting, Tony is attracted to Frank's trophy wife, Elvira. Frank hires Tony and Manny. Tony reunites with his mother and younger sister Gina, of whom he is overprotective. Disgusted by his life of crime, his mother throws him out. Manny is attracted to Gina, but Tony tells him to stay away from her.
Frank sends Tony and Omar to Cochabamba, Bolivia to meet with cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa. Tony negotiates a deal without Frank's approval, angering Omar. Sosa claims that Omar is a police informant and that Frank has poor judgement; Tony witnesses a beaten Omar hanged from a helicopter. Tony vouches for Frank's organization, and Sosa, taking a liking to Tony, agrees to the deal, but not before warning Tony never to betray him.
Back in Miami, Frank is infuriated by Omar's demise and the unauthorized deal struck by Tony, while Tony starts his own independent cocaine operation. At a nightclub, Bernstein, a corrupt police detective on Frank's payroll, attempts to extort money from Tony in return for police protection. Tony spots Gina fraternizing with a man and beats them both when he sees him grope her. Hitmen then attempt to assassinate Tony, who escapes but is wounded. He confronts Frank and Bernstein, certain that they orchestrated the attack; Frank confesses his involvement at gunpoint and begs for his life, but he and Bernstein are killed by Manny and Tony, respectively. Tony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa's product, using his profits to build a multi-million-dollar business empire and construct a vast, heavily guarded estate.
In 1983, a sting operation by federal agents results in Tony being charged with tax evasion and money laundering, with an inevitable prison sentence. Sosa offers to use his government connections to keep Tony out of prison, but only if Tony assassinates an activist intending to expose Sosa's drug operations. During a public dinner, Tony accuses Manny of causing his arrest and Elvira of being an infertile junkie, causing Elvira to leave him.
Tony travels to New York City to carry out the assassination with Sosa's henchman, Shadow, who plants a radio-controlled bomb under the activist's car. However, when the activist is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children, Tony tries to call off the hit. Shadow refuses to back down, and Tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. Tony returns to Miami, where an enraged Sosa calls him to promise retribution for allowing the activist to deliver the exposé. Tony, at his mother's behest, tracks down Gina and finds her with Manny; in a fit of rage, Tony shoots Manny dead, after which Gina tearfully tells Tony that they were married the day before. A distraught Tony returns to his estate with Gina, and begins a massive cocaine binge in his office.
While dozens of Sosa's men begin to invade the estate and kill all of Tony's guards, Gina accuses Tony of wanting her for himself and shoots at him. One of Sosa's men kills her and is in turn killed by Tony. A distraught Tony holds Gina's corpse, while admitting his love and tells her he'll be right back. With assassins outside his office, Tony turns a grenade launcher-equipped rifle on them, mowing down many. Tony is repeatedly shot by the remaining attackers, but continues to taunt them until he is fatally shot from behind by The Skull. Tony's corpse falls into a fountain below, in front of a statue with the inscription ""The World is Yours"".

Section: Development (2):
Scarface began development after Al Pacino saw the 1932 film of the same name at the Tiffany Theater while in Los Angeles. He later called his manager, producer Martin Bregman, and informed him of his belief in the potential for a remake of that film. Pacino originally wanted to retain the period piece aspect, but realized that because of its melodramatic nature it would be difficult to accomplish. Sidney Lumet became attached as the director, developing the idea for Montana to be Cuban arriving in America during the Mariel boatlift.Bregman and Lumet's creative differences saw Lumet drop out of the project. Lumet had wanted to make a more political story that focused on blaming the current Presidential administration for the influx of cocaine into the United States, yet Bregman disagreed. Bregman replaced him with Brian De Palma, and hired writer Oliver Stone; Stone had seen the original 1932 Scarface and had not enjoyed it, so he initially rejected the offer. Only after he talked to Lumet was he convinced to accept the offer since they agreed on transforming the film from a period piece to a contemporary film, saying, ""Sidney had a great idea to take the 1930s American prohibition gangster movie and make it into a modern immigrant gangster movie dealing with the same problems that we had then, that we're prohibiting drugs instead of alcohol. There's a prohibition against drugs that's created the same criminal class as (prohibition of alcohol) created the Mafia."" In the book The Oliver Stone Experience, Stone stated, ""I didn't want to do an Italian Mafia movie ... We'd had dozens of these things. But then Bregman came back to me and said, Sidney has a great idea — he wants to do it as a Marielito picture in Miami. I said, That's interesting! Sidney's idea was a good one.""Stone researched the script while battling his own cocaine addiction. He and Bregman performed their own research, traveling to Miami, Florida, where they were given access to records from the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Organized Crime Bureau. Stone moved to Paris to write the script, believing he could not break his addiction while in the United States, stating in a 2003 interview that he was completely off drugs at the time ""because I don't think cocaine helps writing. It's very destructive to the brain cells.""

Section: Casting (2):
Pacino insisted on taking the lead role as Tony Montana, although Robert De Niro had been offered it and had turned it down. Pacino worked with experts in knife combat, trainers, and boxer Roberto Durán to attain the body type that he wanted for the role. Durán also helped inspire the character, who had ""a certain lion in him"", according to Pacino. Meryl Streep's immigrant character in Sophie's Choice (1982) also influenced Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana. Bauer and a dialect coach helped him learn aspects of the Cuban Spanish language and pronunciation.Pfeiffer was an unknown actress at the time, and both Pacino and De Palma had argued against her casting, but Bregman fought for her inclusion. Glenn Close was the original choice for the role, while others were also considered, including Geena Davis, Carrie Fisher, Kelly McGillis, Sharon Stone, and Sigourney Weaver.Bauer got his role without even auditioning. During the audition process, casting director Alixe Gordin saw Bauer and instantly noted that he was right for the role of Manny, a judgment with which both De Palma and Bregman agreed. He was the only actual Cuban in the principal cast. John Travolta was considered for the role.

Section: Filming (2):
Despite the film being set in Miami, much of the film was shot in Los Angeles due to the Miami Tourist Board declining requests to film there as it feared the film would deter tourism to the city with its themes of drugs and gangsters. Tony's opulent mansion was El Fureidis, a Roman-styled mansion near Santa Barbara, California. The picture was shot over 24 weeks from November 22, 1982 to May 6, 1983. In April 1983, however, a scene was shot at Miami's Fontainebleau Miami Beach. The special effects were performed by Ken Pepiot and Stan Parks.The production was halted twice for severe weather events in California. During production in March, Pacino burned his left hand on the muzzle of the gun that had just been fired when he tripped during a fight scene. Production was shut down for more than a week while Pacino recovered. A premature bomb explosion also injured two stuntmen during a scene shot in his absence. The gunfight scene at the end of the film also includes a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. Powdered baby laxative was used as the fake substance for cocaine in the film; Pacino's nasal passage was minorly damaged due to snorting large quantities over the course of filming.

Section: Rating (2):
Less than two months before the film's release, on October 28, 1983, Scarface was given an X rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""excessive and cumulative violence and for language."" De Palma had already re-cut the film three times by that point; De Palma stated ""I said I've had it with these people, I'm not taking any more out."" Bregman told The New York Times, ""We have been designated as a pornographic film ... We'll accept the X rating and appeal."" Universal would not release the film with an X rating due to the porn perception and the reduction of ticket sales being from ticket buyers, most newspapers, TV, and radio stations, who would not run ads for an X-rated film. On November 8, an appeal board composed of 20 theater owners, studio executives and independent distributors overturned the decision 17 to 3 in favor of an R rating—more than two-thirds required. De Palma believed that the changes were minor enough to be unnoticeable, but released the film uncut anyway, only confessing to it months after the film's release.

Section: Music (2):
Instead of using popular music from the period in which the film is set, the music in Scarface was produced by Academy Award-winning Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder. Reflecting Moroder's style, the soundtrack consists mostly of muzak-like synthesized new wave, electronic music. De Palma said that he repeatedly denied Universal's requests to release the film with a ""pop"" score because he felt Moroder's score was adequate.

Section: Critical response (2):
The original release of Scarface was met with a negative critical response, and was criticised for its violence and graphic language. The New York Magazine defined it as an empty, bullying, and overblown B movie.Writers Kurt Vonnegut and John Irving were among those who walked out in disgust after the notorious chainsaw scene.
At the middle of the film, Scorsese turned to Bauer and told him, ""You guys are great – but be prepared, because they're going to hate it in Hollywood ... because it's about them.""Roger Ebert rated it four stars out of four in his 1983 review, and he later added it to his ""Great Movies"" list. Ebert wrote, ""DePalma and his writer, Oliver Stone, have created a gallery of specific individuals, and one of the fascinations of the movie is that we aren't watching crime-movie clichés, we're watching people who are criminals."" Vincent Canby praised the film in The New York Times: ""The dominant mood of the film is... bleak and futile: what goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting.""Leonard Maltin was among those critics who held a negative opinion of Scarface. He gave the film 1½ stars out of four, stating that Scarface ""wallows in excess and unpleasantness for nearly three hours, and offers no new insights except that crime doesn't pay. At least the 1932 movie moved."" Maltin included an addendum to his review in later editions of his annual movie guide, stating his surprise with the film's newfound popularity as a cult-classic.In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, ""If Scarface makes you shudder, it's from what you think you see and from the accumulated tension of this feral landscape. It's a grand, shallow, decadent entertainment, which like all good Hollywood gangster movies delivers the punch and counterpunch of glamour and disgust"". Jay Scott writes in his review for The Globe and Mail, ""For a while, Al Pacino is hypnotic as Montana. But the effort expended on the flawless Cuban accent and the attempts to flesh out a character cut from inch-thick cardboard are hopeless."" In his review for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold wrote, ""A movie that appeared intent on revealing an alarmingly contemporary criminal subculture gradually reverts to underworld cliche, covering its derivative tracks with outrageous decor and an apocalyptic, production number finale, ingeniously choreographed to leave the antihero floating face down in a literal bloodbath.""On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 82% approval rating based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 7.54/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Director Brian De Palma and star Al Pacino take it to the limit in this stylized, ultra-violent and eminently quotable gangster epic that walks a thin white line between moral drama and celebratory excess."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".

Section: Depiction of stereotypes (2):
During filming, some Cubans objected to the film's Cuban characters being portrayed as criminals by mostly non-Cuban actors. The film featured a disclaimer following its credits stating in red, all-cap lettering ""Scarface is a fictional account of the activities of a small group of ruthless criminals. The characters do not represent the Cuban/American community and it would be erroneous and unfair to suggest that they do. The vast majority of Cuban/Americans have demonstrated a dedication, vitality and enterprise that has enriched the American scene.""In 2008, Damarys Ocaña of The Guardian wrote that the film reinforces stereotypes of Marielito Cubans, as it exaggerated the number of criminals in the Mariel boatlift. She also called Pacino's portrayal of a Cuban-American as having a ""ridiculous accent and overacting."" However, of the approximate 125,000 refugees that entered the United States on the boatlift, around 16,000 to 20,000 were estimated to be criminals or ""undesirables"" according to a 1985 Sun Sentinel magazine article. In a 1985 report around 350 to 400 Mariel Cubans were reported to inhabit Dade County jails on a typical day.However, Demetrio Perez, the city commissioner of Miami, led the charge against the film. Estimates assert that the Cuban refugees only included some 2,700 hardened criminals. In The Oliver Stone Experience, Stone stated ""Well, Tony Montana was a gangster ... His mother and his sister represent the clean-cut Cuban community. His mother scolds him: You're a scumbag, get out of my house! You're ruining your sister! So there is a strong morality in the movie. I knew about the criticisms even in advance, that Cubans were not like that. But I'm sorry: A lot of Cubans did become Marielitos. If I'd done it about Colombians, they would've said the same thing: 'You're anti-Colombian'.""

Starring Max Pomeranc, Joe Mantegna, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley, and Laurence Fishburne, it is based on the life of prodigy chess player Joshua Waitzkin, played by Pomeranc, and adapted from the book of the same name by Joshua's father Fred. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography in the 66th Academy Awards.","Section: Plot (1):
Seven-year-old Josh Waitzkin becomes fascinated with the chess players in Washington Square Park. Josh's mother, Bonnie, is initially uncomfortable with her young son's interest, as the games in the park are rife with illegal gambling and homeless players, but eventually allows Josh to play a game with a disheveled player for $5. Although Josh loses, Bonnie is amazed that Josh understands the rules of chess, despite having never been taught them. Another park player, Vinnie Livermore, alerts Bonnie to Josh's advanced talent in the game.
Josh's father, Fred, asks to play a game with his son and swiftly defeats him. It emerges, however, that Josh deliberately lost to spare his father's feelings. When Fred prompts Josh to play a rematch honestly, Josh effortlessly defeats him.
A friendship blooms between Josh and Vinnie, who becomes a mentor to Josh. Fred seeks out the services of Bruce Pandolfini, as a formal chess tutor for his son. Bruce takes an immediate liking to Josh, but disapproves of many of the maverick tactics he has adopted from Vinnie's tutelage. In particular, Bruce disapproves of Josh's tendency to bring out his queen too early, and warns Fred that such careless tactics will weaken Josh's performance in organized chess tournaments.
Against Bruce's advice, Fred enrolls Josh in a chess tournament. Josh wins; the first in a slew of tournament victories for him. Fred develops an unhealthy obsession with Josh's chess career, causing friction between Fred, Bonnie, and Josh's school teacher. Josh, upset by the changes he has noticed in his father, begins losing tournaments.
As a remedy, Fred dedicates Josh entirely to Bruce's teaching regimen, and at Bruce's request, Josh is forbidden from playing any more games with Vinnie. Bruce's relationship with Josh grows cold and misanthropic as Bruce seeks to harden Josh's competitiveness. When Bruce berates Josh by showering him in ""meaningless xeroxes"" of a certificate that Bruce had previously told Josh was a special award, Bonnie kicks Bruce out of the house.
Fred and Josh reconcile, with Fred assuring Josh that he loves his son, even if he isn't a chess champion. Josh is allowed to resume playing chess with Vinnie and his enthusiasm for the game returns.
Josh attends the National Chess Championship tournament, where he and Bruce reconcile. In the final game, Josh faces off against Jonathan Poe, another young prodigy whose talent has intimidated Josh throughout the movie. Josh's use of Vinnie's reckless tactics causes him to lose his queen early in the game; however, they later earn him an advantage when he is able to claim Jonathan's queen.
Jonathan makes a late-game blunder and Josh draws on Bruce's disciplines to recognize that he can seize an inevitable victory. Instead, Josh offers his opponent a draw. Jonathan, not realizing his own predicament, refuses. The game proceeds and Josh wins.
The film ends with Fred and Bonnie looking on proudly, as Josh encourages his young friend, Morgan, by telling him: ""You're a much stronger player than I was at your age.""

Some famous chess players have brief cameos in the film: Anjelina Belakovskaia, Joel Benjamin, Roman Dzindzichashvili, Kamran Shirazi, along with the real Joshua Waitzkin, Bruce Pandolfini, Vincent Livermore, and Russell Garber. Chess master Asa Hoffmann is played by Austin Pendleton; the real Hoffmann did not like the way he was portrayed. Chess expert Poe McClinton, still a park regular, is seen throughout the film. Pal Benko was supposed to be in the film but his part was cut out. Waitzkin's real mother and sister also have cameos.  Bobby Fischer appears in newsreel footage.
The Russian player in the park (played by Vasek Simek) who holds up the sign ""Game or Photograf Of Man Who Beet [sic] Tal 1953 • Five Dollars"", was based on the real life of Israel Zilber, who would regularly sleep in the park, awakening only for a ""five dollar game"" that he would demand in a Russian accent (reduced to ""two dollar game"" during slow times if requested) and which he would invariably win.  Zilber also played the Queen's Gambit as White. Zilber, Latvian Chess Champion in 1958, defeated the teenage Mikhail Tal in 1952, and during most of the 1980s was homeless and regarded as one of the top players in Washington Square Park.

Waitzkin's main chess foil character in the film, Jonathan Poe (played by Michael Nirenberg), is based on chess prodigy Jeff Sarwer. When Sarwer was asked what he felt about his portrayal in the film, he stated: At the end of the day it was a Hollywood film, a work of fiction, and it helped popularize chess more so that's always a good thing. But I have a lot of distance to the actual book and film, the way I was portrayed was nothing at all like how I was in real life so what's the point in comparing myself to it?

",,"Section: Reception (1):
The book and the film have each received positive reviews from critics. Waitzkin's book was praised by GM Nigel Short, as well as chess journalist Edward Winter, who called it ""a delightful book"" in which ""the topics [are] treated with an acuity and grace that offer the reviewer something quotable on almost every page."" Screenwriter and playwright Tom Stoppard called the book ""well written"" and ""captivating"".  No doubt this was in large part due to Fred Waitzkin writing most of the book while waiting patiently outside of his son's tournament games, often for hours, where he could regularly be seen sketching into a legal pad his observations about both his son and America's obsession at the time with finding the ""Next Fischer"".  
The film currently has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.13/10. The site's consensus reads: ""As sensitive as the young man at its center, Searching for Bobby Fischer uses a prodigy's struggle to find personal balance as the background for a powerfully moving drama."" Roger Ebert gave the film a score of four stars (out of four), calling it ""a film of remarkable sensitivity and insight"", adding, ""by the end of [the film], we have learned […] a great deal about human nature."" James Berardinelli gave the film three stars (out of four), calling it ""an intensely fascinating movie capable of involving those who are ignorant about chess as well as those who love it.""Bobby Fischer never saw the film and strongly complained that it was an invasion of his privacy by using his name without his permission. Fischer never received any compensation from the film, calling it ""a monumental swindle"".The film was nominated for Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) at the 66th Academy Awards for 1993 but lost to Janusz Kaminski who won for Schindler's List. It won the category at the American Society of Cinematographers the same year. The film also ranked No. 96 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers.

PETA wrote the movie ""is not to be missed"" and encouraged readers to host watch parties. Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand commended the film for promoting various marine issues, but challenged the conclusion of abstaining from fish consumption, distinguishing between industrial fishing and traditional harvesting. Greenpeace instead suggested alternate solutions.A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) said the film's coverage of Scottish salmon aquaculture was ""wrong, misleading and inaccurate"". The Global Aquaculture Alliance also criticised the film, saying ""reputable NGOs have worked tirelessly with industry over the past 20-plus years to continually improve the lives of the people working in aquaculture and fisheries as well as the ecosystems in which aquaculture and fisheries are practiced"", and suggested abandoning fisheries and aquaculture would ""abandon the approximately 250 million people employed by the industry and rob billions of people of a healthful source of protein"".Charles Clover of Blue Marine Foundation and author of the book The End of the Line criticised the film's scientific accuracy, saying ""there are a few jaw-dropping factual errors"", and accused it of deriving its narrative from previous documentaries, such as the film adaptation of his book. Nonetheless, he praised its communication of marine fisheries and conservation issues to a new audience, stating ""[t]he problem of overfishing is immense, global, remote, horrifying and it is really hard to get people to focus on. Until now, Tabrizi’s generation thought banning plastic straws was more important. But it isn’t. Overfishing is.""Ray Hilborn, Professor at the School of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences at the University of Washington called the film ""propaganda"" and ""so full of misinformation, it’s astounding"".

The German folklorists Brothers Grimm's collection of fairy tales compiled in Grimm's Fairy Tales (1812) has influenced world culture. According to the creators of the film for over two centuries, Hansel and Gretel has been adapted into feature films in many countries such as South Korea, Japan, Germany, and the United States.The first adaptation was in Germany by opera composer Engelbert Humperdinck who decided to adapt a series of entertaining verses into a full opera, Hänsel und Gretel that was performed in the German Empire on 23 December 1893. The music was in the style of German folk songs. The opera was written to unearth the humor and comedy behind Grimm's fairy tale.In 1954 three films released in the United States, Germany, West Germany based on the fairy tale. The United States version, Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy was the nation's first non-Disney animated film produced by company RKO Pictures that was reviewed as a Technicolor production built in the Machine Age. In the same year, Germany released Hänsel und Gretel directed by Walter Janssen. The film was described from a review at University of Düsseldorf as a post-war reinterpretation of the fairy tale suitable for viewing for all audiences. In West Germany, Fritz Genschow released Hänsel und Gretel, a family film interpretation of the fairy tale. Director Tim Burton's first live-action production was Hansel and Gretel that was lost ever since it showed only once in Disney Channel in 1983.

Section: Development (2):
In 2018, the press service of Wizart Animation revealed plans for a Hansel and Gretel film. According to research from Wizart Animation, no recently made major animated film about Hansel and Gretel has been released. Disney released Children in the Thicket in 1932 and the animated musical Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy was released in 1954. In context to their previous films, Wizart Animation is focusing on story integrity and humor. On 6 November 2019 American Film Market, the studio revealed the exclusive poster and preliminary collection of artwork for the film Hansel and Gretel. Wizart Animation has experience in adapting 19th century fairy tales for the film industry that was featured in their The Snow Queen films. It is intended they will utilize their inspiration and knowledge from their previous series to adapt a story from the globally recognized brand known as Brothers Grimm fairy tales.At the 2019 MIPCOM in Cannes, Wizart Animation showcased a preview of Hansel and Gretel. The events were part of the mipcom News magazine. On 13 October 2019, a presentation of domestic animation projects was held at MIPJunior. Presented by Evgenia Markova, an official representative of the international markets MIPCOM, MIPJunior, and MIPTV, new material for Hansel and Gretel was featured.Wizart Animation founded a production pact with American-based film production studio QED International. As a major international distributor under the parent company Media Content Capital, QED has managed to release such critical films as District 9. The company has also produced films with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Both companies agreed to creatively bolster the prospects for an international distribution collaboration.Yuri Moskvin, producer for Wizart, was in attendance as the managers from both sides signed a production pact. The arrangement is intended for high quality distribution. Sasha Shapiro of QED, stated: “We have been looking into both investment possibilities and creative expansion within the family/kids’ genre, and I believe that Wizart has all necessary potentials we have been looking for.” The collaboration is one of Wizart Animation's first time entering into American film market, as they never had thorough motion picture theatrical release in the United States due to the countries' high throughput.At the September 2019, Toronto International Film Festival, as well as the 2020 EFM film market in Berlin, the film was presented. At the 2020 Miami Kidscreen Summit, Hansel and Gretel was presented.

Section: Scriptwriting (2):
While the original fairy tale is historically known for the different horror films adaptations, the writers took a different route and based an adaptation of the fairy tale within the genres of comedy and film family. The adaptation was created in a way to be in the template used by Brothers Grimm from their fairy tales that had both horror and comedy.For years the script was in development. The scriptwriters stated adapting the classic European fairy tale was complicated, since it had only two settings, a gingerbread house and a dense forest. However the opportunity was one of the script writing team's creative challenges. More than 57 script variants were written. One scenario involved a father and his children living in a forest. One day, he is kidnapped by a witch, and the children go in search of him. They fall into a trap, and they have to serve an evil sorceress. At the same time, the children develop a plan to save themselves and save their father. The authors then explored the concept of the super-agent school where the troublemakers Hansel and Gretel enroll in. By the final script, the idea of a spy movie with super-agents was finalized.The scriptwriters focused on character development. In the final version of the script, the main characters turn into children. The concept allowed them to completely transform some of the darker undertones in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale into a suitable scenario. The film emphasized the detective component, revolving the story around the story's main setting, the Secret Magic Control Agency. The scriptwriters reviewed films from the James Bond series, Kingsman, as well as Soviet Union 1968 spy film The Diamond Arm.The writers intend to keep the main characters Hansel, Gretel, and Gingerbread House sorceress intact while expanding the magic forest and Gingerbread House settings. They noted the scale at which they developed the fairy tale universe is intended to keep the knowledgeable viewers of the fairy tale engaged. The idea of creating a Magical Security Agency opened up new directions for film production. The script turned into a global story with references to elements from other cultures including Baba Yaga, the antagonist fantasy grandmother character of Slavic mythology, the Frog Princess, mermaids on branches, boots-runners, yellow sphere gingerbread Kolobok-like character who is the villain's main weapon, Hogwarts whose architecture inspired Secret Magic Control Agency interior design, Sword in Stone, Pandora's Box, and the Aladdin's Lamp.

Section: Themes (3):
Fantasy elements became cosmopolitan as Pushkin's fairy tales combined with western European fantasy. The conflict of the plot revolves around the villain Ilvira. The writers explored the concept of love and sweets by Elvira's cooking with cookies, cupcakes, and candy. Ilvira was designed based on a caricature of the 1960s American actress Marilyn Monroe.Themes addressed in the film include family relationships, their importance and especially the family bond between siblings, even if they are sometimes incompatible with each other, as in the case of brother and sister Hansel and Gretel. One of the main themes of the original fairy tale Hansel and Gretel is  the concept of sibling loyalties. Brothers Grimm described how the siblings affected by poverty and parental loss grew up to trust and be loyal with each other. The film explores the concept of kinship. The concept is described when super-agent sister Gretel and rogue brother Hansel must find common ground to rescue the King by affirming their sibling loyalty.

Section: Animation (2):
The animation quality for the film was denoted as innovative and at an advanced level. The animation took about three years, translating the storyboards which were first drawn in pencil into 3D. It was noted that more than 60 thousand frames were drawn in sync with the music. The episodes were changed more than thirty times. Over fifteen departments worked on the film and each frame moved according to the principle of a conveyor belt system. Animation for the film was considerably influenced by works from prominent artists. The gingerbread house will be based on the work of Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí. The animators were influenced by director Tim Burton's ability to transform horror elements to charming characters featured in such films as the stop-motion animated film Corpse Bride. The film is based on a new animation special effects system, the animation studio itself engineered. The system is based on the studio's own pipeline. The graphics technology will avail of new special effects and facial and skeleton setup which they intend to share with other independent studios in the future.

Section: Music (2):
The score for Secret Magic Control Agency is composed by Gabriel Hays. The composer noted writing music for the genres of spy and fantasy required more thought because the music would contrast with each other. Additionally this area of music is generally unexplored. Using the ""fun, whimsy, and heart"" classical characters Hansel and Gretel as a template, the music was able to meld the fantasy with the spy genre.

","A fun, fantasy family adventure having such a dry, bureaucratic-sounding title as Secret Magic Control Agency is probably the first clue that Netflix’s new animated offering is Russian. There are plenty more all throughout, though, even if the improving animation studio Wizart has made sure to make the film palatable for a global audience. They’ve done likewise with the target demographic, ensuring that the kiddies will have enough magic, cute animals, and anthropomorphized confectionary to distract them from the more adult-skewing material. Fans of the Brothers Grimm will have an extra treat with all the ways that this film radically – and sometimes cleverly – reworks the classic Hansel and Gretel story for a new crowd.

Here, Gretel works for the titular agency, which is basically the Men in Black but for magicians and sorcerers. She’s a standout, almost bootlicking special agent with a borderline pathological devotion to the state (how very Russian!), but she’s as stumped as anyone else when a monarch of the vaguely defined but apparently pluralist “Kingdom” is kidnapped by a monstrous spaghetti man brought to life by black magic. With nowhere else to turn, the agency’s head Agent Stepmother enlists the help of Gretel’s estranged brother, Hansel, a professional charlatan who makes a decent living faking magical powers for gullible crowds and has previous experience in making people and objects vanish without a trace – even if he returns them afterward.Naturally, the siblings aren’t on good terms – Gretel has never forgiven her brother for betraying the heroic principles of their parents (she doesn’t know that he spends his profits on helping the truly needy with “magical coins” that are just cold currency), and since she’s so hung up on the idea that she has achieved everything through her own hard work and diligence, she’s appalled that he’s basically a layabout conman. You can expect a plot point about this.

The big plot point, though, is that early into their reluctant partnership Hansel and Gretel are, through magical means, transformed into their childhood selves, making their mission much more complicated since nobody recognizes them or takes them remotely seriously. This is where Secret Magic Control Agency kicks into a higher gear, stringing together imaginative adventure set-pieces with quieter scenes of sibling bonding, and a lot of riffing on established properties. The agency’s archive room is a treasure trove of nods and winks to everything from Pandora’s Box to the One Ring, and the humor and animation styles are cribbed from all over the place.

What’s missing, for the most part, is a single unifying theme beyond a sibling bond, which is only to be expected given the source material. Not all films have to be about something, obviously, especially not animated family pictures, but it helps when they are. Fantasy is a particularly rich canvas for unpacking specific ideas, but Secret Magic Control Agency has too many to count, and nowhere near enough room to make much of any of them. There are, for instance, two witches, one a classical Baba Yaga more reminiscent of a fairytale, and the other a disgruntled cook with designs to bewitch the state using magical cookies who seems more of a Western archetype. Perhaps, given the prevalence of food in the narrative, it’s fitting that the film wants to have its cake and eat it. But that doesn’t mean it won’t be stuffed afterward.

Not to worry, though, since there’s plenty of enjoyable adventure to be had here. Kids will be understandably enraptured by the visuals, and there are enough pleasant tweaks to the age-old story that it’s satisfying to see how they all come together, especially with details like the famous trail of crumbs and the introduction of the Brothers Grimm themselves fulfilling a very specific and indeed meta role for the agency. Among the crowded Netflix thumbnails, Secret Magic Control Agency slots right in alongside something like Son of Bigfoot as a serviceable animated adventure that is probably better than you were expecting but could have been a lot more.

Klara serves in Syria in the French Army as an interpreter for Opération Chammal. After the apprehension of a suspected terrorist, she witnesses the man's young son blow himself up at his father's behest with explosives hidden on his body. Traumatized by the blast and experiencing migraine headaches from it, she is transferred home to Nice and moves back in with her mother, Maria, and her sister, Tania, while serving in counter-terrorist operations as part of Opération Sentinelle. On patrol, her trauma manifests itself in impulsive, sometimes disproportionally violent behavior towards suspects. The painkillers she was prescribed are not enough for her and she begins to buy more illegally.
One night, Klara and Tania go out to a nightclub. Tania separates from Klara to join a party of Russians and signals to Klara that she is leaving with them. Klara keeps an eye on her sister as she begins to dance with a woman, and afterwards has a lesbian tryst with her. The next day she is notified that Tania had been raped and savagely beaten into a coma. Klara starts her own investigation of the crime, inspects the club's security footage, finds out the name of the man Tania was with, and takes a photograph of him in the footage.  Captain Muller of the French Police, who is leading the investigation, identifies the suspect as Yvan Kadnikov, the son of Leonid Kadnikov who is a very influential Russian tycoon. Yvan is hiding out in his father's villa at Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, but both have diplomatic passports and immunity, making them untouchable without a complicated legal process.
Unwilling to wait for justice, Klara catches Yvan at the nightclub and he tells her that he had not touched her sister. His friends come to his rescue and Klara is evicted after a fight with them. Later, she infiltrates Leonid's villa to find Yvan, but is captured by Leonid's bodyguards. Leonid taunts Klara, freely admitting that it was he who had raped Tania since his son was not interested in women because he was a homosexual. He leaves her to be drowned by his guards, but Klara fights free and escapes. Tania later awakens from her coma, but decides not to press charges despite Klara's urging her to do so. While outside her sister's hospital room, Klara sees a news report in which Leonid states that he will be returning to Russia soon. She notices a nurse rushing past her and right afterwards Tania has a sudden embolism. Suspecting an attempt on her sister's life, Klara pursues and catches the female assassin. Captain Muller informs Klara that she had been sent by Leonid.
Now fully bent on revenge, Klara steals several weapons from her garrison's armory and sneaks into Leonid's hideout. After killing the bodyguards, she pushes Leonid off a bannister when he tries to bribe her, and when she observes his body assumes he's been killed. Klara is stabbed by Yvan and shoots him dead. Seriously injured, she retreats as a tactical police unit arrives. Leonid, however, surprisingly survived the fall and regained consciousness.
Three months later, Leonid is in his Dubai hotel suite and asks the hostesses for room service. Disguised as one of them, Klara brings him a fruit basket, grabs a fork, and rapidly stabs Leonid several times in the jugular and around the neck with it. She secretly travels back to Nice to check in on Tania from a distance. Tania is hanging out with friends and has physically recovered from her ordeal. After observing her without Tania noticing and seeing that she is all right, Klara walks away, now as a fugitive from the law.

","Currently featuring on Netflix's daily Top 10 chart is action-thriller Sentinelle, starring French actress and former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko as a traumatised interpreter for the French army who has returned home from the Middle East and finds herself going against the law to hunt down the people who raped her younger sister.

Directed by Julien Leclercq, Sentinelle is another film based on revenge as it is one of the more popular themes in the action genre. So, if you've seen movies like Taken (2008), The Equalizer (2014) or John Wick (2014), this movie fits into that sub-genre. While it's relatively short at 80 minutes -- which means it can be watched to just pass time without too much commitment -- Sentinelle still feels like another half-baked work that suffers from a poorly written script and generic fight scenes.

The plot follows the life of Klara (Kurylenko), a soldier who served in Syria as an interpreter for the French army, before being transferred home to Paris after a traumatic event. Besides reuniting with her family, Klara is also reassigned to a unit known as Project Sentinelle, whose main task is to patrol areas susceptible to terrorist attacks, and this means observing public spaces. Although she's trying to rebuild herself and move on in life, something happens after a night out to a club where Klara's sister Tania (Marilyn Lima) is involved in a tragic attack and goes into a coma. As a result, Klara decides to take matters into her own hands -- despite the fact that she's employed by the French military -- as she tries to investigate what happened to her sister and find out who's responsible for her condition.Being that this is an action-thriller with lots of intense drama and different action scenes, I went in expecting it to take you straight into fast-paced action and engaging drama in terms of character development. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The film starts out quite slow and the actual conflict in this movie kicks in at about the 30-minute mark, which is odd because that means there's just less than an hour remaining. That being said, once the actual conflict begins, the movie follows the well worn path that most action flicks take.The main character, Klara, is disturbed and has an obsession for vengeance without a solid reason. There's nothing wrong with Kurylenko's performance as she plays a soldier with PTSD fairly well despite having little to work with. We know that she's a victim of trauma and she turns to other things to hide from her emotions, however, the story doesn't really delve deep into her psyche or give us enough of her background to allow any sort of connection to be built with her character. While I wanted to root for Klara, I wasn't clear why I was rooting for her other than out of a sense of justice.The storyline throughout just doesn't make sense. It's messy, riddled with clichés, and features conventional dialogue. Other characters in the film were also poorly written and have no development. I felt like the movie could have used a solid supporting character that's fleshed out just to complement Klara, so that we could see a different side of her. When it comes to the action element, I think it's pretty generic and few and far between. So, please don't expect something frenetic like Taken or the John Wick series because the way the action is choreographed here is bad and feels very amateur.

Also, much of the plot is predictable too. This may be typical for many action movies but the ending was just too obvious. Sentinelle may be a quick watch but there are also certainly better things out there to spend your time on.",4.7,5441,"Action,Drama,Thriller",Negative,0.551

It is the sequel to the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes, and features the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The film's screenplay was written by Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Holmes and Watson, alongside Noomi Rapace as Simza, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty. Rachel McAdams reprised her role as Irene Adler in a cameo appearance. Although the film follows an original premise, it incorporates elements of Conan Doyle's short stories ""The Final Problem"" (1893) and ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" (1903). In the film, Holmes and Watson travel across Europe with a Romani adventuress to foil an intricate plot by their cunning nemesis, Professor Moriarty, to instigate a war.
Upon its release, the film received generally positive reviews from critics. It was commercially successful, with a worldwide gross of over $545 million. A third film is set for release on December 22, 2021 with Downey and Law set to return.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1891, Irene Adler delivers a package to Dr. Hoffmanstahl, payment for a letter he was to deliver. Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb that is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes takes the letter while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated moments later. Adler meets with Professor Moriarty to explain the events, but Moriarty, deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes, seemingly poisons and kills her.
Later, Dr. Watson arrives at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks and business acquisitions around the globe that he has connected to Moriarty. After meeting up with his brother Mycroft at Watson's bachelor party, Holmes meets with a Rom fortune-teller named Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Holmes subtly requests Watson and Mary be left alone now that Watson is no longer working with him, but Moriarty indicates he will kill them if Holmes interferes. Voicing his respect for Holmes' perseverance, Moriarty taunts Holmes about murdering Adler, and Holmes swears revenge.
Moriarty's men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair to protect them, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty's men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris to locate Simza. When she is found, Holmes tells Simza that she has been targeted because Rene is working for Moriarty and may have told her about his plans. Simza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and Rene had formerly belonged. They learn that the anarchists have been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty.
The trio follows Holmes' deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, Holmes realizes too late that he has been tricked and that the bomb is in a nearby hotel; its explosion kills a number of assembled businessmen. Holmes discovers that the bomb was a cover for the specific assassination of Alfred Meinhard, one of the attendees, by Moriarty's henchman, Sebastian Moran. Meinhard's death grants Moriarty ownership of Meinhard's arms factory in Germany. Holmes, not wishing to repeat his mistake from the previous evening, spies on Moriarty, learning he is travelling to Germany. Holmes deduces it is to visit his newly acquired factory and so the trio follow him there.
At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and tortures Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty's plot, revealing that the Professor secretly acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies using various pseudonyms to conceal his identity and intends to instigate a world war to make himself a fortune. Meanwhile, Watson uses the cannon he had been hiding behind to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed. The structure collapses into the warehouse where Moriarty is holding Holmes captive. Watson, Simza, and an injured Holmes reunite and escape aboard a moving train. Holmes deduces that Moriarty's final target will be a peace summit in Switzerland, creating an international incident.
At the summit, Holmes deduces that Rene is the assassin and that he is disguised as one of the ambassadors, having been given radical reconstructive surgery by Hoffmanstahl. Holmes and Moriarty, who is also in attendance, retreat upon a balcony to discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. Watson and Simza find Rene and stop his assassination attempt, but Rene is discreetly killed by Moran. Despite his war being averted, Moriarty remains confident in his victory, warning Holmes that the nations of Europe will inevitably go to war with one another regardless of Moriarty's manipulations. Holmes then reveals that, while being tortured by Moriarty, he replaced the professor's personal diary that contained all his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary in London, who decrypted the code using a book that Holmes had noticed in Moriarty's office during their first meeting, before passing the information to Inspector Lestrade, who seizes Moriarty's assets and donates his fortune to anti-war charities. Holmes and Moriarty anticipate an impending physical altercation, and both realise that Moriarty would win due to Holmes' injured shoulder. Out of options and with the sadistic Moriarty vengefully vowing to kill Watson and Mary afterward, Holmes grabs Moriarty and lunges backwards over the balcony and into the Reichenbach Falls below. Both are presumed dead.
Following Holmes' funeral, Watson and Mary prepare to have their belated honeymoon when Watson receives a package containing a breathing device of Mycroft's that Holmes had noticed and expressed a liking for before the summit. Realizing that Holmes may still be alive, Watson leaves his office to find the delivery man. Holmes, having concealed himself in Watson's office by using one of his urban camouflage suits, reads Watson's memoirs on the typewriter and adds a question mark after the words ""The End"".

After the success of the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes, a sequel was fast-tracked by Warner Bros. with director Guy Ritchie dropping out of an adaptation of Lobo and Robert Downey Jr. leaving Cowboys & Aliens. It was unclear if Rachel McAdams would appear in the film. McAdams said, ""If I do, it won't be a very big thing. It's not a lead part"". Warner Bros. later confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that McAdams would play a part in the sequel but that it would be a cameo. The female lead role was played by Noomi Rapace. Joel Silver, the film's producer, has said that ""we always intended to have a different kind of girl for each movie"" in the vein of Bond girls. He found it ""complicated"" to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: ""She loved being with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role.""The film, then under the running title of Sherlock Holmes 2, was reported to be influenced by Conan Doyle's ""The Final Problem"". While the film took place a year after the events of the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was intended to be a stand-alone film that did not require knowledge of the previous movie.In October 2010, the steamship PS Waverley was chartered on the English Channel for filming, and a large green screen was erected at Didcot Railway Centre with a large action scene filmed there in mid-November. In late November, a scene was filmed at Victoria Bridge, which is part of the Severn Valley Railway. In January 2011, scenes were also filmed at Hampton Court Palace and areas in Oxford University, Oxford, England. Filming also took place in September 2011 in Greenwich at the Royal Naval College.In early February 2011, principal photography moved for two days to Strasbourg, France. Shooting took place on, around, and inside Strasbourg Cathedral. The scene was said to be the opening scene of the film, as it covered an assassination/bombing in a German-speaking town.The production also filmed at several locations in Kent including Fort Amherst, Knole in Sevenoaks, and The Historic Dockyard Chatham. The White Cliffs of Dover can also be seen in the background of the scene where Watson and Sherlock travel by boat to France. Several scenes were also filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire.

The score was composed by Hans Zimmer. Zimmer and director Guy Ritchie traveled to Slovakia, Italy, and France to research the authentic Roma music. Zimmer and his core musicians all with National Democratic Institute members, visited seven Roma villages to learn about the Roma people and ""listen to as many musicians as we could."" Deeply impressed, Zimmer arranged for 13 of the Roma musicians with their violins and accordions to join him in Vienna at a studio for a recording session. Zimmer wove this Roma music into the score for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Besides discovering the wonderful cultural music, Zimmer also said he had never seen such poverty in Central Europe. A portion of proceeds from the soundtrack will help the Roma pay for necessities like water, heating and bus fare to get their children to school. The soundtrack also contains works of Johann Strauss II, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ennio Morricone and Franz Schubert.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 59% based on 227 reviews, with a rating average of 6.02/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a good yarn thanks to its well-matched leading men but overall stumbles duplicating the well-oiled thrills of the original."" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, gives the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert, who gave the first film three stars, was even more positive in his review for A Game of Shadows, awarding it three-and-a-half stars and calling it ""high-caliber entertainment"" that ""add[s] a degree of refinement and invention"" to the formula, and that the ""writers…wisely devote some of their best scenes to one-on-ones between Holmes and Moriarty."" James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing: ""A Game of Shadows is a stronger, better realized movie that builds upon the strengths of the original and jettisons some of the weaknesses."" Conversely, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club felt that the film ""aims lower than its predecessor's modest ambition, and still misses the mark."" Several critics felt that McAdams was underused. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt ""she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise."" Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post remarked that she ""exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here than she did in all of the previous film. Freed from the constraints of being the de-facto love interest, McAdams relishes the chance to go full-villain.""

The plot follows a group of Yeti who come across a human, with each species thinking the other was just a myth.
Smallfoot was theatrically released in the United States on September 28, 2018. It received a mostly positive reception from critics and grossed over $214 million worldwide.","Section: Plot (1):
A village of Yetis lives in isolation on the top of a mountain in the Himalayas, above the clouds and hidden away from sight. Migo is a yeti who abides by the law of the ancient stones held by the Stonekeeper, the yetis' leader. Migo's father, Dorgle, projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head, as the yetis believe this wakes up the sun. While learning how to ring the gong, Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper's daughter, Meechee, whom he has a crush on, and misses the gong, landing outside the village. There, Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a ""smallfoot"" (human), whom the yetis believe is mythical. Migo runs back to inform the villagers, but he lacks proof, and Stonekeeper claims he is lying and banishes him from the village. Migo is suddenly visited by rejected yetis Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem who bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society (S.E.S.), which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo to travel below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is nothing underneath. After some hesitation, Migo agrees to go, but his rope snaps and Migo falls, where he discovers land.
Percy Patterson is a British human filmmaker of wildlife documentaries who has lost most of his viewership. He meets the pilot who saw Migo, and in an attempt to regain his fame, tries unsuccessfully to convince his assistant, Brenda, to dress up as a yeti for filming. Migo arrives and unknowingly scares Percy when trying to communicate with him. Migo takes Percy with him and they stop in a cave to wait out a blizzard. Percy films and uploads a video of Migo narrating that the Yeti plans to eat him, before attempting to escape. While chasing Percy, Migo's toe becomes caught in a bear trap and Percy takes pity on him by removing the trap and bandaging Migo's wound. Percy agrees to go with Migo and they head back up the mountain, where they reunite with the S.E.S.
The villagers are confused by Percy's appearance, but happily accept him and learn about his culture, much to Stonekeeper's dismay. Afterwards, Stonekeeper takes Migo inside the palace and reveals the truth: yetis used to live below the clouds, but were forced into hiding by the humans who attacked them. To keep them safe, they created the stones, and the clouds are actually steam made by the yetis' daily tasks to keep them hidden. In order to protect the village, Migo agrees to continue the lie by telling the yetis that Percy, who is experiencing high altitude sickness, is just a hairless wild yak. Stonekeeper takes Percy and locks him in a box, so Percy will be unable to alert other humans of the yetis' whereabouts. Migo later discovers that Meechee took Percy away to return him home, and jumps down the mountain with Gwangi and Kolka following suit.
Percy recovers and discovers that his video of Migo has generated public excitement, but then notices that Meechee has become distracted by the wonders in Kathmandu and accidentally causes a disruption. Meechee is attacked by the police, but is rescued by Gwangi, Kolka and Migo. As Mingo tries to explain to Meechee that humans are monsters, they see a mural depicting a yeti attacking people and realize that humans view them as monsters. The yetis try to make it back to the mountain, but are chased by a SWAT helicopter that Stonekeeper takes down using his stones. Migo attempts to divert the police away from the other yetis, when Percy arrives on his snowmobile and shoots Migo with a tranquilizer gun to save him. The police chase and capture Percy in his yeti suit, and arrest him for public disturbance and fraud.
Back at the village, inside the palace, Migo explains the truth to the yetis and apologizes for lying to them. He tells the others that even though humans may still be scared of the yetis, they should try to communicate with them. The yetis leave the village, and when Percy and Brenda notice them, they emerge from the crowd and stand up for the yetis. The rest of the humans slowly welcome the yetis and accept them into their lives.

Writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa conceived of Smallfoot, interested in a story about Yeti or Bigfoot; they drew inspiration from an original idea by Sergio Pablos.The concept for Smallfoot was in development before director Karey Kirkpatrick joined the project in July 2016; he viewed an animatic in which Percy was a ""ski bum type"" with no motivation on his personality in the first drafts of the script and repetitive gag lines, and so they added more elements in his later revisions by giving arc and depth to his character. Kirkpatrick also said Meechee was undeveloped, and she was made head of the S.E.S. in rewrites. Observing Brexit and a rise in nationalism, Kirkpatrick also drew inspiration:

Truth was under attack ... certainly phrases like alternative facts were being thrown around.  So, it became an age of misinformation fueled by agendas that are often fueled by fear. And like, 'I want this result, and so I am skewing the truth.' That is just in the zeitgeist.
On May 11, 2017, it was announced that the film was in-production with Channing Tatum, Zendaya, and Gina Rodriguez providing the lead voice roles. Ely Henry was originally hired as a scratch vocal for the film four years before its release, however was later invited to join the cast and subsequently voiced Fleem in the final product. The film was animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks, who had also provided animation for the Warner Animation Group's Storks, and utilized Autodesk Maya for the animation process. Ryan O'Loughlin, a DreamWorks Animation veteran, was originally the film's director, but was replaced by Kirkpatrick.

The film originally had no songs until six months into production when the suggestion of making the film a musical came from Toby Emmerich, who was recently elected as chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group at the time, partially because the Kirkpatrick brothers had previously written the music and lyrics for the Tony-winning Broadway musical Something Rotten!.The songs include ""Perfection"" by Channing Tatum, ""Wonderful Life"" by Zendaya, ""Percy's Pressure"" by James Corden (music from the song ""Under Pressure"", additional lyrics by Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick), ""Wonderful Questions"" by Tatum & Zendaya, ""Let It Lie"" by Common, ""Moment of Truth"" by CYN, and ""Finally Free"" by Niall Horan (written by Horan, Ian Franzino, Andrew Hass, John Ryan and Julian Bunetta).The soundtrack peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200.

92,So My Grandma's a Lesbian!,Spain,Airam Films,Netflix,,,95,,,,,,,,"With So My Grandma’s A Lesbian! (Salir del Ropero), Netflix has once again added to their long list of international and Spanish-language films, as well as their ever-growing collection of LGBTQ stories. This sweet Spanish comedy tells the story of a lesbian couple in their 70s who finally decide to get married and share their truth with their respective families. With So My Grandma’s A Lesbian! (Salir del Ropero), Netflix has once again added to their long list of international and Spanish-language films, as well as their ever-growing collection of LGBTQ stories. This sweet Spanish comedy tells the story of a lesbian couple in their 70s who finally decide to get married and share their truth with their respective families. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: So My Grandma’s A Lesbian! definitely echoes a lot of those quirky-family-coming-together flicks out there, and both its leads juggle the consequences of coming out the way we see in Hulu’s Happiest Season.

Performance Worth Watching: The entire ensemble puts in some great work here, but I found myself particularly moved by Verónica Forqué, who stars as Eva’s grandmother Sofía. While a lot of the performers in So My Grandma’s A Lesbian! make some goofier choices, Forqué’s performance is incredibly grounded, bringing a sense of authenticity to the film. She feels like she could be your own grandmother, warm and kind and frank, and her personal journey – and the way she comes to grips with her identity – feels like the most significant one in the film.

Memorable Dialogue: “You have to live life fearlessly. It’s the only way to be happy,” Sofía tells Eva as she finally breaks down. It’s simple, but it really does feel like the heart of the film.

Sex and Skin: There is some affectionate nuzzling, a few make out scenes between various characters, and a very hot shirtless man, but overall, the sexy stuff here is pretty tame.

Our Take: I really, really wanted to love So My Grandma’s A Lesbian!. It has all the tools to succeed; an idyllic setting, a wonderful cast, a potentially fun, moving premise. But all of this is no match for the film’s obsession with its more minor storylines, storylines about selfish straight people that are given much more screen time than our central couple. The more interesting version of So My Grandma’s A Lesbian! would make the story of Sofía and Celia – two women in their 70s who finally feel ready to live their lives in the open – but instead, the film is obsessed with Eva’s dalliances and her frankly boring uptight potential in-laws. I understand the desire to create significant conflict here, but there is more than enough story within Sofía and Celia’s coming out. It makes the whole fiancé plot feel totally superfluous. It would be one thing if we really understood why Eva was so obsessed with marrying him, or if they had more than a single iota of chemistry, but the heat is so obvious between Eva and Jorge from their first encounter, it’s impossible not to wonder why on earth she is risking her beloved grandmother’s happiness for her own lackluster union.

All the Eva and Stuart stuff would almost be forgivable if he had not returned in the film’s second half for a bizarre, unnecessary appearance that did little but attempt to create some kind of comic relief in the midst of chaos (but only ended up adding further to the chaos). Despite Ingrid García Jonsson’s lovely, funny, and resonant performance, Eva almost feels like a villain here; she’s far too intelligent – emotionally and otherwise – to stand in the way of someone she loves so much, and by the film’s baffling final shot, I couldn’t help but wonder what it might have looked like with a rewrite that left Eva in the wings for longer periods of time. She is seemingly intended to be the heart of So My Grandma’s A Lesbian!, but her self-absorbed nature – which isn’t even resolved with her so-called growth by the end – prevents her from being the hero the film so wants us to root for. The better film would have made the titular lesbian grandma the star. I just wish that was the one we got to see.

Our Call: SKIP IT, but know there are certainly worse options for a casual weekend viewing. So My Grandma’s A Lesbian! is a sweet, well-acted movie, but unfortunately, the film gets so caught up in its unnecessary side plots that it winds up feeling much longer than its 90-minute runtime.",4.2,809,Comedy,Positive,0.977

Regarded as the first Korean space blockbuster, it was released on Netflix on February 5, 2021.","Section: Plot (1):
In the year 2092, Earth has become nearly uninhabitable. The UTS Corporation builds a new orbiting home for humanity that mimics the natural processes on Earth; however, only a chosen few are permitted to ascend and become UTS citizens, while those remaining on Earth breathe in polluted air. 
To regulate the population in orbit and keep an eye on the non-citizens, UTS governs them via a strict set of rules and taxes. Many non-citizens from all across the globe work as space sweepers, collecting space debris floating in Earth's orbit and selling it to the company factory for survival. The plot follows such a crew of space sweepers and their ship, the Victory.
Victory's crew has Kim Tae-ho, Tiger Park and Bubs (an android), all led by Captain Jang. Tiger Park handles the ship's machinery and was a drug baron on Earth. Bubs used to be a robot soldier but now helps repair the ship and cast the net for space junk while saving up to get a complete skin graft. Captain Jang was one of the child geniuses sponsored by UTS and created several hi-tech inventions for the company but, after discovering the company's true workings, became a pirate and tried to assassinate James Sullivan. Her crew was killed and Sullivan survived, so she changed identities and had an eye transplant. Tae-ho, once a child soldier, is on a search for his daughter (Su-ni); who was lost and ejected into space after a space debris collided with the station they were staying at. His sole life aim is to pay for the authorities' recovery team to locate her body tracker before she drifts out of orbit and gets lost in space forever.
After picking up a car floating in orbit, they discover a child in it. News reports say that she is a robot named Dorothy, and has a weapon of mass destruction inside her created by the terrorist group Black Fox. The crew also finds a smartphone in Dorothy's bag with several missed calls from someone named Kang Hyeon-u. They call back and, assuming the other party to be part of the Black Fox group, negotiate two million dollars for returning Dorothy. Tiger finds Dorothy drawing in his cabin and starts a conversation with her, as he finds himself drawn to her. 
Tae-ho and Tiger carry Dorothy to a night club to collect the ransom, but she wanders off in the crowd. UTS soldiers are lain in wait and a massacre ensues. Tiger and Tae-ho locate Dorothy when Soldier 01 zeroes in on them and shoots her blaster. Dorothy's eyes change color, and the trio are protected from the blast by a sort of force field around them. Captain Jang is watching everything through a feed on the ship. She also notices the man who came to collect Dorothy shouting after her and calling her Kot-Nim. As she watches Dorothy protect Tae-ho and Tiger, something clicks in Jang's mind. The trio make it back to the ship and Dorothy busies herself drawing and playing. When asked by Jang what her name really is, Dorothy says Kot-Nim is her Korean name. Tae-ho ignores her, thinking she is a robot, while Tiger becomes friendly with her and suggests keeping her. Tae-ho dismisses the idea and goes to set up another call with Kang Hyeon-u to rearrange the exchange. 
Dorothy and Tae-ho find tomatoes on the plant that Dorothy had helped revive from a dead tree, and sell them. Captain Jang finds papers in Dorothy's backpack and goes through them. Bubs puts makeup on Dorothy and tells her the story of Tae-ho. As a child soldier, Tae-ho was Soldier 01 at the age of 17. On one of his voyages, Tae-ho shoots and boards a ship that carries several fleeing non-citizens and kills them all. He notices a baby still alive in the arms of a dead woman and adopts the girl. She rekindles his humanity and Tae-ho finds himself unable to hurt others - as a result, he is dismissed from the force, made homeless and reduced to a non-citizen. After one year of homelessness, Tae-ho becomes desperate and gambles, neglecting Su-ni. She wanders away to find a snack, and while outside there is a debris impact that causes her to be blown into space as Tae-ho desperately witnesses it behind a airlock.
A masked man follows Kot-Nim to the toilet in the factory. Her screams alert Tae-ho and Tiger who rush to save her, but they are ambushed by a group of masked people. Tiger beats them all and Captain Jang intervenes, discovering they are other space junk collectors. Their leader explains that Black Fox is not a terrorist organization, but rather an environmental group, and that Kot-Nim is not an android but a human child. Born with a congenital disease, her father Kang Hyeon-u injected her with nanobots found in space debris to save her life. The nanobots helped treat Kot-Nim, but they also gave her a unique power: Kot-Nim could now communicate with other nanobots and heal and protect things. Sullivan found this out and used Kot-Nim to turn Mars into a healthy, green planet. He plans to kill Dorothy in a hydrogen bomb explosion (since nanobots can only be destroyed by breaking them into atoms through extreme high temperatures). And given its proximity to Earth, the explosion would cause the factory to fall onto the planet, destroying the Earth and making Mars the only viable option for all humans.
The crew decide to unite Kot-Nim with her father and disable the bomb, with the help of the Black Foxes who will locate and take Dr. Kang to the meeting point. Soldiers attack them, but Tae-ho and Kot-nim manage to flee on the Victory. They enter a space debris field while trying to flee, and nanobots surround their ship and begin to consume it. Kot-nim communicates with them, and the nanobots disperse. They enter the factory where the meet-up is scheduled, only to be ambushed. The UTS soldiers kill all the Black Foxes and Dr. Kang before taking Kot-Nim away. Sullivan leaves Tae-ho four million dollars in return for abandoning Kot-Nim. Tae-ho takes the money, but the rest decide to save Kot-Nim – even if it kills them. Tae-ho goes to give the money to the UTS officers and they hand over Su-ni's last found remains to him – her clothes, crayons and Korean writing book. In it, Su-ni had written that she wanted to be a good person like her father. This reminds Tae-ho of the promise he made to Su-ni, to be the best man she had ever known. He takes back the money, and returns to the ship with a new zeal before they all go to save Kot-Nim. 
Sullivan goes live, announcing the Mars program. The bomb has been armed in the factory, and Kot-Nim is strapped to it on a chair. The team free Kot-Nim, but Captain Jang discovers that the bomb can not be defused. It will not only destroy anything in its blast range, but also destroy any nanobots in the vicinity of 5,000 kilometers. The only way Kot-Nim's nanobots (and so her life) can be saved is if she is out of range. The team sets off to fly 5,000 km away, but are interrupted by Soldier 01. Tiger fights with her and ejects her from the factory. The team send out a message to the rest of the Space Sweepers who come to their aid, fighting the attacking troops. The population of Earth learns of Sullivan's true goals when they hear him recount his plan through the Space Sweepers' emergency comms channel. The Victory is intercepted by Sullivan himself who, in a ship of his own, tries to fight the crew to get back Kot-Nim. When it seems they have lost the battle, Tiger and Tae-ho manage a final boost that puts the ship just out of the blast range. The crew reveal their real plan – Kot-Nim was safe with other Space Sweepers. The Victory had removed the bomb from the core and carried it away, ready to sacrifice their lives to save Earth and Kot-Nim. The bomb explodes; however, Kot-Nim has summoned the nanobots to protect the Victory, keeping the crew safe. 
In the aftermath of the battle, UTS apologizes for the cover-up of the true goals and promise to help make Earth more habitable. Kot-Nim is adopted by the crew and, using her powers, enables Tae-Ho to say goodbye to Su-ni. Bubs gets her skin graft. Tiger and Tae-Ho take Kot-Nim down to Earth to help grow trees and they all continue space sweeping.

The early working title of the film was Lightning Arc (Korean: 번개호; RR: Beongaeho).Jo Sung-hee started writing the story 10 years prior to the film's release, after a friend talked to him about the dangers of space junk. He said that ""It started with the idea of space travelers collecting space junk. I heard about how these fast-moving fragments of space debris are growing and leading to in-space collisions. I realized that this subject has already been dealt with in animations and games, but never in a film. I started writing the script wondering how Koreans, who possess a tenacious mentality, would approach this problem.""In May 2019, the Chinese multinational entertainment company Huayi Tencent invested $4.2 million in the film. The visual effects company Dexter Studios, which was behind the production of the films Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds, Ashfall and Wandering Earth, was hired for Space Sweepers.

The film was announced in 2018 as an adaptation of the 2013 novel Robert B. Parker's Wonderland by author Ace Atkins. It was released on March 6, 2020, by Netflix to mixed reviews.","Section: Plot (1):
Boston police officer Spenser arrives with his partner, Driscoll, to the home of Captain John Boylan. While questioning Boylan, Spenser sees Mrs. Boylan's bloody face and beats Boylan. Spenser is brought up on charges, pleads guilty, and is sentenced to prison. While incarcerated, Spenser studies to become a truck driver and is released after serving five years. But shortly before, he is warned to leave Boston and never return. Spenser is met outside by his friend Henry Cimoli. They drive to Cimoli's residence, where Spenser is reunited with Driscoll and takes up residence with Henry and his roommate, Hawk.
Boylan attends a meeting at a bus yard, where an SUV collides with his car. Boylan is dragged from his car and murdered. Detective Terrence Graham is discovered murdered in the same SUV. Spenser and Henry learn about Boylan's death shortly before Driscoll and his partner arrive at the residence to question him about his possible involvement. Henry provides Spenser with an alibi and cites Hawk as another. A news report implicating Detective Graham in Boylan's murder inspires Spenser to investigate the murder due to his acquaintance with Graham and his belief that he was unlikely to commit suicide.
Spenser questions Letitia about the night of the murder, before heading to a police bar where she said Graham had been that night and meeting with Scotty Traylor, Terrence's partner. Traylor confirms Letitia's story that Terrence had suspected Boylan of being dirty. Spenser gains access to the CCTV footage from the store across the street where he observed Terrence getting into a Corvette, while two others got into his SUV and followed him. Spenser visits the bus yard and discovers a toothpick on the ground similar to the ones Driscoll uses. He heads to Driscoll's gym to ask him about the murder. Driscoll attempts to dissuade him away from the case, and denies having been to the crime scene.
Spenser chases a Corvette similar to the one on the footage on foot and is attacked by a dog. Hawk catches the license plate number of the car and traces it to Charles Bentwood. Spenser, Henry, and Hawk begin surveillance of Bentwood and observe him making a hand off to Macklin. They discover an FBI team led by Agent Burton is also surveilling. Spenser questions Squeeb (an inmate during his time in the Walpole prison), which leads him to Wonderland Greyhound Park, the site of a future casino, and escorted off the property.
Driscoll and Macklin decide to kill Spenser. Some men attempt to kill Spenser at a restaurant, but he's rescued by Hawk. Henry's house is not safe, so Spenser calls his ex, Cissy for a place for Henry, Hawk, and himself to stay. Letitia’s apartment has been tossed. She calls Spenser for help, and when he shows up she gives him a recording Terrence had mailed to her, of a meeting, confirming that Boylan was dirty, and implicating Bentwood, Macklin, and Driscoll. Spenser confronts Driscoll and offers him the chance to turn himself in, which he declines. Spenser brings it to Agent Burton who deems it insufficient evidence.
Spenser tracks down Bentwood and interrogates him, resulting in Bentwood's confession that there’s a shipment of drugs coming to Wonderland. Spenser and Hawk find the shipment and force it off the road, then take down two of the gang members inside, with the third escaping. Spenser's reporter contact declares the drugs to be insufficient evidence. Spenser receives a call from Henry's phone from Driscoll. Driscoll demands a meeting with Spenser at Wonderland, threatening to kill Henry if he doesn't bring the drugs.
Spenser, Hawk, and Cissy go to Wonderland where Driscoll and others are gathered on the track. Spenser and Hawk arrive in a truck and plow through the gang members' vehicles. Driscoll flees into the race track's clubhouse and Spenser pursues him, culminating in a brawl between the two of them that results in Spenser performing a citizen's arrest. They pile the drugs and other evidence on the infield and leave Driscoll, Bentwood, and Macklin restrained nearby. Spenser and Hawk are declared heroes, the casino project is shut down, Boylan and Driscoll are charged in Weisnewski's murder, and Driscoll is convicted and sent to prison. 
Spenser, Hawk, Cissy and Henry celebrates the victory by going to a local diner, having lobsters as a celebratory dinner. The scene then interrupts with the TV in the diner showing news that Boston Fire Department Chief Marty Foley being arrested, over charges of arson. The scene ends with Spenser going deep into thought, with Cissy and Henry attempts to draw Spenser out of another intervention recuse.

95,Spider-Man,United States,Columbia Pictures,Sony Pictures Releasing,Tobey Maguire Willem Dafoe Kirsten Dunst James Franco Cliff Robertson Rosemary Harris,David Koepp,121,Sam Raimi,139000000,825000000,"Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in the Spider-Man trilogy, and stars Tobey Maguire as the title character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film centers on outcast teen genius Peter Parker, who develops spider-like superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, and decides to use his newfound powers to fight crime in New York City as Spider-Man.
Development on a live-action Spider-Man film began in the 1980s. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors Tim Burton, Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Jan de Bont, M. Night Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January 8 to June 30, 2001. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the film's visual effects.Spider-Man premiered at the Mann Village Theater on April 29, 2002, and was released in the United States four days later on May 3. The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics. The film became the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend as well as the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $821.7 million worldwide, it was the third highest-grossing film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film and the sixth highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. Spider-Man is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster. After its success, the film spawned two sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, released in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","Section: Plot (1):
On a school trip, high school senior Peter Parker visits a Columbia University genetics lab, where he is bitten by a genetically engineered ""super spider"" that escaped containment, and apparently falls ill after returning home. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, owner of scientific corporation Oscorp, tries to land a major military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable performance-enhancing chemical and goes insane, killing his assistant.
The next morning, Peter discovers that he is no longer myopic and his body has metamorphosed into a more muscular physique. At school, he discovers that he can shoot spiderwebs from his wrists, and that he has accelerated reflexes, as demonstrated in a confrontation with bully Flash Thompson. Peter later finds out that he has also developed superhuman strength, the ability to stick to surfaces, and an increased ability to sense danger. Ignoring his Uncle Ben's advice that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" Peter considers impressing his crush Mary Jane Watson with a car. He enters a clandestine wrestling tournament to raise money and wins his first match, but the promoter cheats him out of his winnings. 
When a thief suddenly robs the promoter's office, Peter allows him to escape. Shortly after, he discovers that Ben was killed by a car thief. Peter pursues and confronts the thief, only to discover that he is the same man he let escape. After Peter disarms him, the thief backs away, scared, and falls through a window to his death. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman sports advanced Oscorp armor and military equipment, and disrupts an experiment by Oscorp's corporate rival, Quest Aerospace, killing several people in the process. The following day, he is shown to have no memory of the event.Upon graduation, Peter begins to use his abilities to fight crime in the city, becoming the costumed superhero Spider-Man.
J. Jonah Jameson, editor of the Daily Bugle newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance photographer, as he is the only person who provides clear images of Spider-Man. However, Jameson uses the pictures to discredit Spider-Man, believing he is a menace. Meanwhile, Norman learns Oscorp's board plans to oust him and sell the company to Quest, and exacts revenge on them as his costumed alter-ego at the World Unity Fair. Spider-Man intervenes and defeats Norman, who escapes. Jameson later dubs the mysterious assassin the ""Green Goblin."" After discovering he has developed a crazed alternate personality, Norman, as the Goblin, offers Spider-Man a place by his side, but he refuses. 
When Norman, his son Harry, who is Peter's best friend, and Mary Jane are invited over for Thanksgiving dinner by Peter's aunt May, Norman deduces that Peter is Spider-Man. He later attacks and hospitalizes May. Meanwhile, Mary Jane admits that she is in love with Spider-Man, who has rescued her numerous times, and asks Peter if Spider-Man ever asked about her. Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, arrives and presumes that she has feelings for Peter after seeing them hold hands. Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, inadvertently revealing Spider-Man's greatest weakness to him. 
The Goblin takes Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island trolley car full of children hostage along the Queensboro Bridge, forcing Spider-Man to choose who he will save. He manages to rescue both, while the civilians nearby side with Spider-Man and taunt the Goblin. Enraged, he grabs Spider-Man and takes him to an abandoned building, where he brutally beats him. When the Goblin brags about how he will later brutally kill Mary Jane, an enraged Spider-Man overpowers him. Norman reveals himself as the Goblin and that he knows Peter is Spider-Man, tricking him into letting his guard down while he controls his glider to impale the hero from behind. Warned by his spider sense, Peter dodges the attack and the glider fatally impales Norman, who asks Peter not to reveal his identity as the Goblin to Harry before dying. 
Spider-Man takes Norman's body to the Osborns' house, where Harry sees him and assumes the hero killed his father. At Norman's funeral, Harry vows revenge on Spider-Man, and claims that Peter is the only family he has left. Mary Jane confesses her feelings for Peter, but he rejects her, fearing that if they were in a relationship, his enemies would try to get to him through her. As he leaves the funeral, Peter remembers Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.

Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:An academically-gifted high school student who is socially inept. After getting bitten by a genetically modified spider, he gains spider-like abilities. Following a personal tragedy, he decides to use his newfound powers for good, and begins fighting crime and injustice as Spider-Man. Maguire was cast as Parker in July 2000, having been Sam Raimi's primary choice for the role after he saw The Cider House Rules. The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not seem to fit the ranks of ""adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans"", but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor was signed for a deal in the range of $3 to $4 million with higher salary options for two sequels. To prepare, Maguire was trained by a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert, taking several months to improve his physique. Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnidlike motion, and had a special diet. The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Freddie Prinze Jr., Chris Klein, Wes Bentley and Heath Ledger. DiCaprio had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1995, while Raimi joked that Prinze ""won't even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film."" In addition, actors Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan and James Franco were involved in screen tests for the lead role.
Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin:A scientist and the CEO of Oscorp who tests an unstable strength enhancer on himself and develops a crazed alternate personality. He later becomes a costumed villain using advanced Oscorp armor and equipment, such as a weaponized glider and pumpkin-shaped explosives; the media dubs his alter-ego the ""Green Goblin."" Norman develops animosity for Spider-Man after the hero refuses to join him, and makes constant attempts to get back at him. Ironically, he takes a liking to Peter almost immediately after meeting him, and sees himself as a father figure for the boy, while ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000. Nicolas Cage, Jason Isaacs, John Malkovich and Jim Carrey turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.
Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson:Peter's love interest ever since he was six years old. Mary Jane has an abusive father, and aspires to become an actress, but gets a job as a waitress at a run down diner, a fact she hides from her boyfriend Harry. She later develops feelings for Peter as they spend more time together, and for his alter-ego, after he saves her on numerous occasions. Kate Bosworth unsuccessfully auditioned for the role. Before Raimi cast Dunst, he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt. Dunst decided to audition after learning Maguire had been cast, feeling the film would have a more independent feel. Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin.
James Franco as Harry Osborn: Peter's best friend and flatmate, Mary Jane's boyfriend and Norman's son who is envious of his father's apparent closeness with Peter. Before being cast as Harry, Franco had screen tested for Spider-Man himself.
Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker: May Parker's husband and Peter's uncle, a laid off electrician who is trying to find a new job. He is killed by a carjacker whom Peter failed to stop, and leaves Peter with the message, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""

Michael Papajohn appears as The Carjacker, the criminal who allegedly murdered Ben Parker. In Spider-Man 3, it is revealed that his name is Dennis Carradine, and that he is not responsible for Ben's death, but rather Flint Marko. Bruce Campbell, a long-time colleague of director Sam Raimi, cameoed as the announcer at the wrestling ring Parker takes part in. Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Parker as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw, played by former professional wrestler ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee briefly appears in the final cut of the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin at the World Unity Fair in Times Square. Octavia Spencer appears as a staff member at Parker's wrestling match. Tig Notaro was offered the role by Raimi and auditioned, but lost it to Spencer. R&B/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself performing at the World Unity Fair. Lucy Lawless also appears as a punk rock girl who says ""Guy with eight hands... sounds hot.""

In the early 1980s, Marvel Comics was in negotiations with film producers to bring their flagship character Spider-Man to the big screen. Producer Roger Corman was the first to hold an option on the Spider-Man property and began to develop the film at Orion Pictures. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee was brought on to write a screenplay which featured Cold War themes and Doctor Octopus as the primary antagonist. The project did not come into fruition following budgetary disputes between Corman and Lee. The film rights were then acquired by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group for $225,000. The two were not familiar with the character's background and mistook Spider-Man for being similar to a werewolf-like character. Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, was hired to write a screenplay based on this concept. Stevens' script featured Peter Parker as an ID-badge photographer who becomes subject to a mad scientist's experiment which transforms him into a human tarantula. Tobe Hooper, who was preparing to shoot The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Invaders from Mars for Cannon, signed on to direct. Stan Lee hated the horror route the studio was taking with the character and demanded that a new script be written that was closer to the source material.
By 1985, a new script was being written by Ted Newsome and John Brancato. In this version, Peter Parker receives his spider-like abilities from a cyclotron experiment. Doctor Octopus served as the antagonist and was written as Parker's mentor turned enemy. Barney Cohen was brought in to do a rewrite which added humor, additional action scenes, and a supporting villain. Cannon hired Joseph Zito to direct the film having previously directed the commercially successful Invasion U.S.A. for the studio. For the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the studio considered Tom Cruise while Zito was interested in casting actor and stuntman Scott Leva who had previously done promotional appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel. Bob Hoskins was considered for Doctor Octopus while Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May. Stan Lee expressed his desire to play J. Jonah Jameson in the film. The project was tentatively titled Spider-Man: The Movie and was budgeted between $15-20 million. Following the critical and financial failure of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and Masters of the Universe which were produced by Cannon, the budget for Spider-Man: The Movie was cut to $7 million. Joseph Zito was unwilling to compromise and stepped down as director. He was replaced by Albert Pyun who was willing to make the film at a lower budget. The project was cancelled following Cannon's acquisition by Pathé and Golan's departure from the studio.Golan extended his option on Spider-Man during his tenure as CEO of 21st Century Film Corporation. By 1989, Golan attempted to revive the project using the original script, budget, and storyboards developed at Cannon. In order to receive production funds, Golan sold the television rights to Viacom, home video rights to Columbia Pictures, and theatrical rights to Carolco Pictures where James Cameron became attached to write and direct the film. Cameron had previously met with Stan Lee to discuss a possible X-Men film until Lee convinced Cameron that he would be a good choice to direct a Spider-Man film. James Cameron submitted a treatment to Carolco in 1993.  which served as a darker, more adult take on the character's mythos. In addition to featuring the Spider-Mans origin story, it also included variations on the villains Electro and Sandman. Electro was reimagined as a megalomaniacal businessman named Carlton Strand while Sandman was written as Strand's personal bodyguard named Boyd. Cameron's treatment also featured heavy profanity and a sex scene between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson atop the Brooklyn Bridge. Carolco had set a $50 million budget for Spider-Man but progress would be stalled when Golan sued Carolco for attempting to make the film without his involvement. Cameron had recently completed True Lies for 20th Century Fox as part of a production deal with the studio. Fox attempted to acquire the film rights to Spider-Man for Cameron but this proved unsuccessful. At this point, James Cameron had abandoned the project and began work on Titanic. He would reveal in a 1997 interview on The Howard Stern Show that he had Titanic star Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the lead role. In 1995, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired 21st Century Film Corporation which had given them access to the previous Spider-Man scripts. MGM would also then sued Viacom, Sony Pictures, and Marvel, who they accused of fraud in the original deal with Cannon. The following year, 21st Century, Carolco, and Marvel would all file for bankruptcy. Marvel would emerge from bankruptcy in 1998 and declare that Menahem Golan's option had expired and that the rights had reverted back to them. Marvel would then sell the film rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment, Columbia Pictures' parent company for $7 million.In April 1999, although Sony Pictures optioned from MGM all preceding script versions of a Spider-Man film, it only exercised the options on ""the Cameron material"", which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five-page ""scriptment"" credited only to James Cameron. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script. The studio lined up Roland Emmerich, Tim Burton, Tony Scott, Chris Columbus, Ang Lee, David Fincher, Jan de Bont and M. Night Shyamalan as potential directors. Fincher did not want to depict the origin story, pitching the film as being based on The Night Gwen Stacy Died storyline, but the studio disagreed. Sam Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000, for a summer 2001 release. He had been a fan of the comic book during his youth, and his passion for Spider-Man earned him the job.Cameron's work became the basis of David Koepp's first draft screenplay, often word for word. Cameron's versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists. Koepp's rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as the secondary antagonist. Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film. In June, Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite Koepp's material. Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the ""organic webshooter"" idea from the Cameron ""scriptment"". Raimi felt he would stretch the audience's suspension of disbelief too far to have Parker invent mechanical webshooters.Rosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences. Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train. As production neared, producer Laura Ziskin hired award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Parker and Mary Jane. Columbia gave the Writers Guild of America a list of four writers as contributors to the final Spider-Man script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.

Section: Filming (2):
With Spider-Man cast, filming was set to begin November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release a year later, but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, filming officially began on January 8, 2001 in Culver City, California. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, certain sequences were re-filmed, and certain images of the Twin Towers were digitally erased from the film. Sony's Stage 29 was used for Parker's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Parker takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California. On March 6, 45-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.In Los Angeles, locations included the Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University lab where Parker is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the Daily Bugle offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home). In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return. They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested. Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center. The crew returned to Los Angeles where production and filming ended in June. The Flatiron Building was used for the Daily Bugle.

Section: Design (2):
Before settling on the look used in the film, the original headgear created for the Green Goblin was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics. 
One concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of was the idea of having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, including the mask. A hard shell was worn underneath the mask to make the shape of the head look better and to keep the mask tight while keeping the wearer comfortable. For scenes where he would take his mask off, there was an alternate suit where the mask was a separate piece. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.

Section: Visual effects (2):
Visual effects supervisor John Dykstra was hired to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000. He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer-generated, as they would have been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production. Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, ""ballet in the sky."" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million. Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.Dykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, ""the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero."" Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being. When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts. In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer-generated.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 245 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Not only does Spider-Man provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.The casting, mainly Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and J. K. Simmons, is often cited as one of the film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the Houston Chronicle, was initially skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but after seeing the film he stated, ""it becomes difficult to imagine anyone else in the role."" USA Today critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's Superman. Owen Gleiberman, of Entertainment Weekly, had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. ""Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey—the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger—together."" The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt thought: ""the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss—after one of his many rescues of her—to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures.""LA Weekly's Manohla Dargis wrote, ""It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated."" Giving it two and a half stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the film lacked a decent action element: ""Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea.""
Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later: ""We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression.""Entertainment Weekly put ""the kiss in Spider-Man"" on its end-of-the-decade ""best-of"" list, saying: ""There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy.""Empire magazine ranked Spider-Man 437 in its 500 Greatest Movies of All Time list in 2008.

Peter Parker is estranged from both his love interest Mary Jane Watson and his best friend Harry Osborn and discovers that his aunt May is facing eviction. He finds himself suffering temporary but recurring losses of his powers, often in life-threatening situations. 
Harry, who is now head of Oscorp's genetic and scientific research division, is sponsoring a fusion power project by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical, killing his wife Rosalie, and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man, shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process. At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius' harness. Without the inhibitor chip, the now sentient arms defend themselves by killing the doctors. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, he decides to re-try his experiment. He robs a bank to fund a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally are there, and Octavius takes May hostage. Peter rescues her, but Octavius flees with the stolen money. The Daily Bugle subsequently dubs the scientist Doctor Octopus.
Mary Jane becomes engaged to astronaut John Jameson, the son of Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown over his inability to balance his life and loses his powers. He quits being Spider-Man, returns to his normal life, and unsuccessfully attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Peter's costume to Jameson, who takes credit for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter tells May the truth behind his uncle Ben's death and how he is responsible. May forgives him, but the rise in New York City's crime rates worries Peter.
Meanwhile, requiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man, whom he believes is responsible for Norman's death. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells Octavius not to harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurrecting. As Jameson admits that he was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the Bugle and goes after Octavius. As Peter battles Octavius, they fall onto a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Peter to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. When he faints from exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him from falling and bring him into the train, seeing his unmasked face but promising to keep their knowledge hidden. They unsuccessfully try to protect him when Octavius returns to capture Peter, whom Octavius delivers to Harry. After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. As Peter arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly, Octavius discovers him, and they battle as the nuclear reaction swells and starts threatening the city. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius commands the tentacles to obey him, and sacrifices himself to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Peter's true identity and feelings, which he says is why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.
Meanwhile, Harry is visited by a vision of his father Norman in a mirror, pleading for Harry to avenge his death. Enraged, Harry shatters the mirror, inadvertently revealing a secret room containing prototypes of the Green Goblin's equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. After they kiss, they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him to go help as Spider-Man.

Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:A superhero, Columbia University physics student, and photographer for the Daily Bugle. Juggling these separate lives means he briefly gives up his responsibilities as a superhero in a moment of adversity. When Maguire signed on to portray Spider-Man in 2000, he was given a three-film contract. After filming Seabiscuit in late 2002, a pre-existing back condition that Maguire suffered from was bothering him and Sony was faced with the possibility of recasting their lead. Negotiations arose to replace Maguire with Jake Gyllenhaal, though Maguire recovered and was able to reprise his role, with a salary of $17 million.

The character was initially considered to appear as the primary antagonist of the first Spider-Man film, played by Ed Harris. For the sequel, Chris Cooper, Christopher Walken, and Robert De Niro were at all considered to play Octavius at one point; Molina was cast in the role in February 2003 and underwent physical training for the role. Raimi had been impressed by his performance in Frida and also felt he had the required physicality. Molina only briefly discussed the role and was not aware that he was a strong contender, and was excited, being a big fan of Marvel Comics.

Section: Development (2):
Immediately after finishing Spider-Man, director Sam Raimi with help from James Keltie segued into directing a sequel. In April 2002, Sony hired Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to write a script of the film. On May 8, 2002, following Spider-Man's record-breaking $115 million opening weekend, Sony Pictures announced a sequel for 2004. Entitled The Amazing Spider-Man, after the character's main comic book title, the film was given a budget of $200 million and aimed for a release date of May 7, 2004. The following month, David Koepp was added to co-write with Gough and Millar.In September 2002, Michael Chabon was hired to rewrite. His draft had a younger Doc Ock, who becomes infatuated with Mary Jane. His mechanical limbs use endorphins to counteract the pain of being attached to his body, which he enjoys. When he injures two muggers on a date, this horrifies Mary Jane and in the resulting battle with Spider-Man his tentacles are fused together, and the fusion begins to kill him. In the script, Octavius is the creator of the genetically-altered spider from the first film, and gives Peter an antidote to remove his powers: this means when Octavius is dying with his tentacles, he wants to extract Spider-Man's spine to save himself. This leads to an alliance with Harry (a detail which made it into the finished film). Beforehand, Harry and the Daily Bugle put a $10 million price on Spider-Man's head, causing the city's citizens to turn against him.Raimi sifted through the previous drafts by Gough, Millar, Koepp and Chabon, picking what he liked with screenwriter Alvin Sargent. He felt that thematically the film had to explore Peter's conflict with his personal wants against his responsibility, exploring the positive and negatives of his chosen path, and how he ultimately decides that he can be happy as a heroic figure. Although the story takes some partial influence from Doc Ock's debut in 1963 and the 1966 storyline If This Be My Destiny...!, the story was mostly inspired by the 1967 storyline Spider-Man No More!, specifically The Amazing Spider-Man #50. It was decided that Doctor Octopus would be kept as the villain, as he was both a visually interesting villain who was a physical match for Spider-Man, and a sympathetic figure with humanity, accompanied by the fact that the character had been repeatedly considered as a villain for the first film over the course of its 15-year development. Raimi changed much of the character's backstory, however, adding the idea of Otto Octavius being a hero of Peter, and how their conflict was about trying to rescue him from his demons rather than kill him.

Section: Filming (2):
Spider-Man 2 was shot on over one hundred sets and locations, beginning with a pre-shoot on the Loop in Chicago during two days in November 2002. The crew acquired a train of 2200 series cars, placing sixteen cameras for background shots of Spider-Man and Doc Ock's train fight. Principal photography began on April 12, 2003 in New York City and Chicago. The crew moved on May 13 to Los Angeles, shooting on sets created by production designer Neil Spisak.  After the scare surrounding his back pains, Tobey Maguire relished performing many of his stunts, even creating a joke of it with Raimi, creating the line ""My back, my back"" as Spider-Man tries to regain his powers. Even Rosemary Harris took a turn, putting her stunt double out of work. In contrast, Alfred Molina joked that the stunt team would ""trick"" him into performing a stunt time and again.

Filming was put on hiatus for eight weeks, in order to build Doc Ock's pier lair. It had been Spisak's idea to use a collapsed pier as Ock's lair, reflecting an exploded version of the previous lab and representing how Octavius' life had collapsed and grown more monstrous, evoking the cinema of Fritz Lang and the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Filming then resumed on that set, having taken fifteen weeks to build, occupying Sony's Stage 30. It was 60 feet (18 m) by 120 feet (37 m) long, and 40 feet (12 m) high, and a quarter-scale miniature was also built for the finale as it collapses. Reshoots for the film continued until December 2003.A camera system called the Spydercam was used to allow filmmakers to express more of Spider-Man's world view, at times dropping fifty stories and with shot lengths of just over 2,400 feet (730 m) in New York or 3,200 feet (980 m) in Los Angeles. For some shots the camera would shoot at six frames per second for a faster playback increasing the sense of speed. Shots using the Spydercam were pre-planned in digital versions of cities, and the camera's movement was controlled with motion control, making it highly cost-effective. The camera system was only used in the previous film for the final shot.

Although roughly the same as before, costume designer James Acheson made numerous subtle changes to Spider-Man's costume. Its colors were made richer and bolder, its spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, its eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and its muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement. Also, the helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eyepieces, which were easier to remove.To create Doctor Octopus' mechanical tentacles, Edge FX was hired to create a corset, a metal and rubber girdle, a rubber spine and four foam rubber tentacles which were 8 feet (2.4 m) long and altogether weighed 100 pounds (45 kg). The claws of each tentacle, which were called ""death flowers"", were controlled by one puppeteer sitting on a chair. Each tentacle was controlled by four people, who rehearsed every scene with Molina so that they could give a natural sense of movement as if the tentacles were moving due to Octavius' muscle movement. On set, Molina referred to his tentacles as ""Larry"", ""Harry"", ""Moe"" and ""Flo"", with ""Flo"" being the top-right tentacle as it was operated by a female grip, and performed delicate operations like removing his glasses and lighting his cigar.Edge FX was only hired to do scenes where Octavius carries his tentacles. CGI was used for when the tentacles carry Octavius: a 20 ft (6.1 m) high rig held Molina to glide through his surroundings, with CG tentacles added later. The CGI versions were scanned straight from the real ones. However, using the real versions was always preferred to save money, and each scene was always filmed first with Edge FX's creations to see if CGI was truly necessary. Completing the illusion, the sound designers chose not to use servo sound effects, feeling it would rob the tentacles of the sense that they were part of Octavius' body, and instead used motorcycle chains and piano wires.

K. Simmons,Sam Raimi Ivan Raimi Alvin Sargent,139,Sam Raimi,258000000,894983373,"Spider-Man 3 is a 2007 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. It was directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent. It is the final installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Set a few months after the events of Spider-Man 2, the story follows Peter Parker as he prepares for his future with Mary Jane Watson, and faces three new villains: Uncle Ben's true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the Sandman after a freak accident; Harry Osborn, his former friend, who is now aware of Peter's identity and seeks to avenge his father; and Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who becomes Venom. Peter also faces his greatest challenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote that augments his abilities but brings out his anger and other negative traits.
Development of Spider-Man 3 began immediately after the successful release of Spider-Man 2 for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created over 900 visual effects shots. With an estimated production budget of $258–350 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release.
Spider-Man 3 premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the third-highest-grossing film of 2007 and was the highest-grossing Spider-Man film until it was surpassed by Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, Spider-Man 3 received a mixed reception from critics, which was later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi, and Arad.
A fourth installment, titled Spider-Man 4, was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a Venom spin-off film, but both were canceled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The Spider-Man film series was rebooted twice; first with The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield; and later a new film series set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, beginning with Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). The Venom spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with Venom, set within Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters and directed by Ruben Fleischer and starring Tom Hardy.","Section: Plot (1):
Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her Broadway musical debut. While the two stargaze in Central Park, a meteorite lands nearby and an extraterrestrial symbiote follows Peter to his apartment by attaching to his motorbike. Harry Osborn, knowing Peter is Spider-Man, seeks to avenge his father Norman's death. Using his father's performance-enhancing gas and Green Goblin technology, he battles Peter to a stalemate, developing partial amnesia. 
Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and sick daughter before fleeing again. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, he gains the ability to control sand and reform his body with it. Marko robs an armored truck, and escapes after easily defeating Spider-Man. NYPD Captain George Stacy, Gwen's father, informs Peter and his aunt May that Marko is uncle Ben's true killer; the initial suspect, the deceased Dennis Carradine, was Marko's accomplice. At his apartment, as Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit while waiting for Marko to come out of hiding, the symbiote assimilates the suit. Peter later awakens atop of a building, discovering that the symbiote has colored his suit black and enhanced his powers; however, it also brings out his dark side. 
Spider-Man locates and battles Marko in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, he opens a pipe, releasing water that reduces Marko to mud and washes him away. Peter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, who is struggling in her career because of her show receiving negative reviews from critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry, but leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination of his father, Harry recovers from his amnesia and forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves ""somebody else,"" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Peter confronts Harry over this and spitefully tells him that his father never loved him. Another battle ensues, with Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face. 
At the Daily Bugle, Peter exposes rival photographer Eddie Brock, whose fake photos depict Spider-Man as a criminal.  Publisher J. Jonah Jameson fires Brock and promotes Peter to staff photographer. Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club, where Mary Jane now works. Peter passionately dances with Gwen in front of Mary Jane, in order to make her jealous. Gwen, realizing this, apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary Jane, Peter finally realizes that the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church's bell tower, and realizing the high-pitched sounds of clanging metal weaken the creature, Peter removes the symbiote. However, Brock follows him and becomes the symbiote's new host. 
As Venom, he locates a still-living Marko and convinces him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. Brock abducts Mary Jane and holds her captive from a web high at a construction site, while Marko keeps police at bay. After Harry refuses to help Peter, Harry's butler finally tells Harry the truth about Norman's death and that it wasn't Peter's doing. While Brock and Marko pin Peter down, Harry arrives with his Green Goblin technology to help Peter and save Mary Jane. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's glider, but Harry jumps in and is impaled himself. Peter, remembering the symbiote's weakness, assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. 
Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote. Brock, having become addicted to its influence, attempts to save the symbiote, and both are vaporized. Afterward, Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted him ever since, and that everything he's done was to try and help his daughter; Peter forgives Marko, allowing him to escape. Harry and Peter reconcile before the former dies from his injuries. After Harry's funeral, Peter visits Mary Jane at the jazz club where she works. They reconcile and share a dance.

Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man: A superhero, a brilliant physics student at Columbia University, and photographer for the Daily Bugle. As he grows arrogant with the city starting to embrace him for the first time in his career, an alien symbiote attaches itself to Peter's costume and influences his behavior for the worse. Maguire said he relished the opportunity to play a less timid Peter in this film.
Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson: Peter Parker's girlfriend and a Broadway actress, whom he has loved since childhood. Mary Jane has a string of bad luck in the film, reminiscent of Peter's misfortune in Spider-Man 2, struggling in her career because of negative reviews and losing her friend when the symbiote takes him over.
James Franco as Harry Osborn / New Goblin: The son of Norman Osborn, and Peter Parker's best friend, who believes Spider-Man murdered his father. After learning Peter is Spider-Man and that Norman was the Green Goblin, Harry becomes the New Goblin to battle his former friend directly.Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman: A small-time thug who has a wife and sick daughter, for whom he steals money to help get the treatment to cure her. He transforms into the Sandman following a freak accident and incurs Peter's wrath when Peter learns he was his Uncle Ben's true killer. Church was approached for Sandman because of his award-winning performance in the film Sideways, and accepted the role despite the lack of a script at the time. The film's Sandman possesses sympathy similarly exhibited by Lon Chaney in his portrayals of misunderstood creatures, as well as Frankenstein's monster, the Golem, and Andy Serkis' portrayals of Gollum and King Kong. Church worked out for sixteen months to improve his physique for the role, gaining 28 pounds of muscle and losing ten pounds of fat.
Topher Grace as Eddie Brock / Venom: Peter's rival at the Daily Bugle. He is exposed by Peter for creating a fake incriminating image of Spider-Man, and leaps at the opportunity to exact his revenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote. Grace had impressed the producers with his performance in the film In Good Company. A big comic book fan who read the first Venom stories as a boy, Grace spent six months working out to prepare for the role, gaining twenty-four pounds of muscle. He approached the character as someone under the influence, similar to an alcoholic or drug addict, and interpreted him as having a bad childhood, which is the key difference between him and Peter. Grace found his costume unpleasant, as it had to be constantly smeared to give a liquid-like feel. The costume took an hour to put on, though prosthetics took four hours to apply. Grace also wore fangs, which bruised his gums.
Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy: Peter's lab partner. He asks her out to embarrass Mary Jane when possessed by the symbiote. Howard said the challenge of playing the role was in reminding many fans of the good-natured character who was Peter's first love in the comics, yet was ""the other woman"" in the film. Howard strived to create a sense that Gwen could potentially be a future girlfriend for him, and that, ""I was not acting like some kind of man-stealing tart."" Howard performed many of her stunts, unaware of the fact she was several months pregnant.
James Cromwell as Captain George Stacy: Gwen's father and a New York City Police Department Captain.
Rosemary Harris as May Parker: The aunt of Peter Parker and the widow of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle. She gives Peter her engagement ring so he can propose to Mary Jane, and gives him lessons in forgiveness.
J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson: The aggressive chief of the Daily Bugle. He has a particular dislike towards Spider-Man, whom he considers a criminal.Several actors reprise their roles from the previous films. Dylan Baker portrays Dr. Curt Connors, a college physics professor under whom Peter Parker studies, while Willem Dafoe portrays Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Harry's late father, who returns as a hallucination to encourage his son to destroy Spider-Man, and Cliff Robertson appears as Ben Parker, Peter's deceased uncle in his final acting appearance before his retirement and death in 2011. Bill Nunn, Ted Raimi, Michael Papajohn, John Paxton, and Elizabeth Banks return as Joseph ""Robbie"" Robertson, a longtime employee at the Daily Bugle, Ted Hoffman, also a longtime employee of the Daily Bugle, Dennis Carradine, the carjacker who was believed to have murdered Uncle Ben, Bernard Houseman, butler to the Osborn family and Betty Brant, the receptionist at the Daily Bugle for J. Jonah Jameson, respectively. Elya Baskin additionally reprises his role as Mr. Ditkovitch, Peter's landlord while Mageina Tovah reprises her role as his daughter Ursula. Joe Manganiello reprises his role as Flash Thompson from the first film in a cameo appearance.
Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo in Spider-Man 3, as he did in the previous Spider-Man films, which he referred to as his ""best cameo"". Actor Bruce Campbell, who had cameo roles as a wrestling ring announcer in Spider-Man and as a rude usher in Spider-Man 2, returns in Spider-Man 3 with a new cameo as a French maître d'. Originally his character, who helps Peter try to propose, was much more antagonistic. Composer Christopher Young appears in the film as a pianist at Mary Jane's theater when she is fired, while producer Grant Curtis cameoed as the driver of an armored car that Sandman attacks. Comedian Dean Edwards played one of the newspaper readers who badmouth Spider-Man. 75-year-old newscaster Hal Fishman appears as himself anchoring the saga of Mary Jane's kidnapping by Venom; he died just fourteen weeks after the movie opened. Actress Lucy Gordon appeared as newscaster Jennifer Dugan.

In March 2004, with Spider-Man 2 being released the coming June, Sony announced that Spider-Man 3 was already in development for a release in summer 2007. By the release of Spider-Man 2, a release date for Spider-Man 3 had been set for May 2, 2007 before production on the sequel had begun. The date was later changed to May 4, 2007. In January 2005, Sony Pictures completed a seven-figure deal with screenwriter Alvin Sargent, who had penned Spider-Man 2, to script Spider-Man 3 with an option to script a fourth film.Immediately after Spider-Man 2's release, Ivan Raimi wrote a treatment over two months, with Sam Raimi deciding to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a sinless vigilante, and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals. Harry Osborn was brought back as Raimi wanted to conclude his storyline. Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father's legacy, but be instead ""somewhere between."" Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character. While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben's killer to increase Peter's guilt over his death and challenge his simplistic perception of the event. Overall, Raimi described the film as being about Peter, Mary Jane, Harry, and the Sandman, with Peter's journey being one of forgiveness.Raimi wanted another villain, and Ben Kingsley was involved in negotiations to play the Vulture before the character was cut. Producer Avi Arad convinced Raimi to include Venom, a character whose perceived ""lack of humanity"" had initially been criticized by Sam Raimi. Venom's alter-ego, Eddie Brock, already had a minor role in the script. Arad felt the series had relied too much on Raimi's personal favorite Spider-Man villains, not characters that modern fans were actually interested in, so Raimi included Venom to please them, and even began to appreciate the character himself. The film's version of the character is an amalgamation of Venom stories. Eddie Brock, Jr., the human part of Venom, serves as a mirror to Peter Parker, with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests. Brock's actions as a journalist in Spider-Man 3 also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism. The producers also suggested adding rival love interest Gwen Stacy, filling in an ""other girl"" type that Raimi already created. With so many additions, Sargent soon found his script so complex that he considered splitting it into two films, but abandoned the idea when he could not create a successful intermediate climax.

Section: Filming (2):
Camera crews spent 2 weeks from November 5–18, 2005 to film sequences that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on the shots early in the project. The same steps had been taken for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.Principal photography for Spider-Man 3 began on January 16, 2006, and wrapped in July 2006 after over 100 days of filming. The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19, 2006. In spring 2006, film location manager Peter Martorano brought camera crews to Cleveland, Ohio, due to the Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city's convention center at no cost. In Cleveland, they shot the battle between Spider-Man and Sandman in the armored car. Afterwards, the team moved to Manhattan, where filming took place at various locations, including One Chase Manhattan Plaza, from May 26, 2006, until July 1, 2006. Shooting placed a strain on Raimi, who often had to move between several units to complete the picture. Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope, as the symbiote Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night.After August, pick-ups were conducted as Raimi sought to film more action scenes. The film then wrapped in October, although additional special effects shots were taken to finalize the production a month later. In early 2007, there were further pick-up shots regarding the resolution of Sandman's story, amounting to four different versions.

Section: Visual effects (2):
John Dykstra, who won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for his work on Spider-Man 2, declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor. Dykstra's colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor, leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks. This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider-Man 3 began production, creating nine hundred visual effects shots.

In addition to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition to Sony Pictures Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.
To understand the effects of sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona was used as the model for the CG sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest. Producer Laura Ziskin said the visual effects budget alone was approximately 30% more than the previous film.Whereas the symbiote suit worn in the comics by Spider-Man was a plain black affair with a large white spider on the front and back, the design was changed for the film to become a black version of Spider-Man's traditional costume, complete with webbing motif. As a consequence of this, the suit Topher Grace wore as Venom also bore the webbing motif; as producer Grant Curtis noted, ""it's the Spider-Man suit, but twisted and mangled in its own right."" Additionally, the motif gave a sense of life to the symbiote, giving it the appearance of gripping onto the character's body. When animating the symbiote, Raimi did not want it to resemble a spider or an octopus, and to give it a sense of character. The CG model is made of many separate strands. When animating Venom himself, animators observed footage of big cats such as lions and cheetahs for the character's agile movements.

Section: Music (2):
Originally, Danny Elfman, the composer for the previous installments, did not plan to return for the third installment of Spider-Man because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi. Elfman said that he had a ""miserable experience"" working with Raimi on Spider-Man 2 and could not comfortably adapt his music. Christopher Young was then announced to score Spider-Man 3 in Elfman's absence.According to Young, Sandman's theme uses ""two contrabass saxophones, two contrabass clarinets, two contrabass bassoons and eight very low French horns"" in order to sound ""low, aggressive and heavy"". Young described Venom's theme as ""Vicious, my instructions on that one were that he's the devil personified. His theme is much more demonic sounding."" Venom's theme uses eight French horns. Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music to the birth of Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films. Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.

David Edelstein of New York magazine misses the ""centrifugal threat"" of Alfred Molina's character, adding that ""the three villains here don't add up to one Doc Ock"" (referring to Molina's portrayal of the character in Spider-Man 2). James Berardinelli felt director Sam Raimi ""overreached his grasp"" by allowing so many villains, specifically saying, ""Venom is one bad guy too many."" Roger Ebert, who gave Spider-Man 2 a glowing review, gave the sequel two out of four stars and thought Church never expressed how Sandman felt about his new powers, something Molina, as Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, did ""with a vengeance""; he said the film was ""a mess,"" with too many villains, subplots, romantic misunderstandings, conversations and ""street crowds looking high into the air and shouting 'oooh!' this way, then swiveling and shouting 'aaah!' that way."" The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who gave Spider-Man 2 a favorable review, gave the film a negative review, characterizing the film as a ""shambles"" which ""makes the rules up as it goes along.""Blogger Roger Friedman of Fox News called the film a ""4-star opera"", noting that while long, there was plenty of humor and action. Andy Khouri of Comic Book Resources praised the film as ""easily the most complex and deftly orchestrated superhero epic ever filmed […] despite the enormous amount of characters, action and sci-fi superhero plot going on in this film, Spider-Man 3 never feels weighted down, tedious or boring."" Jonathan Ross, a big fan of the comic books, felt the film was the best of the trilogy. Richard Corliss of Time commended the filmmakers for their ability to ""dramatize feelings of angst and personal betrayal worthy of an Ingmar Bergman film, and then to dress them up in gaudy comic-book colors"". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe, who gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, wrote that it was a well-made, fresh film, but would leave the viewer ""overfulfilled"". Jonathan Dean of Total Film felt the film's complex plot helped the film's pacing, in that, ""it rarely feels disjointed or loose […] Spider-Man cements its shelf-life."" Entertainment Weekly named the Sandman as the eighth best computer-generated film character.John Hartl of MSNBC gave Spider-Man 3 a positive review, but stated that it has some flaws such as having ""too many storylines"". His opinion is echoed by Houston Chronicle's Amy Biancolli who complained that ""the script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series' charming idiosyncrasy is sometimes lost in the noise."" Jack Matthews of Daily News thought the film was too devoted to the ""quiet conversations"" of Peter and Mary Jane, but that fans would not be disappointed by the action. Finally, Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly felt that the director ""substituted scope and scale for the warmth and wit that made those two previous pictures so memorable."" Raimi himself would later call the film ""awful"" during a podcast interview. Speaking to Screen Rant in 2018, Avi Arad also accepted responsibility for pushing Raimi to include Venom in the film, and how the end result had disappointed many fans of the character, saying ""I think we learned that Venom is not a sideshow. In all fairness, I'll take the guilt because of what Sam Raimi used to say in all of these interviews feeling guilty that I forced him into it.""

It is the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as  Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In Spider-Man: Homecoming, Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture.
In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the character rights of Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.
Spider-Man: Homecoming premiered in Hollywood on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, 2017, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Homecoming grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone and focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances of Holland and Keaton. A sequel, Spider-Man: Far From Home, was released on July 2, 2019. A third film, Spider-Man: No Way Home, is scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021.","Section: Plot (1):
Following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control, a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons. Eight years later, Peter Parker is drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute in Berlin, but resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger.
Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend Ned eventually discovers his secret identity. Parker comes across Toomes' associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.
Parker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the Washington Monument, where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush Liz. Returning to New York City, aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers and confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.
Parker returns to his high school life, and  asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's dad. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters. He leaves the dance, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit, and races to Toomes' lair. Though he is ambushed by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. He leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away, Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time, and Stark proposes to Pepper Potts. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his Aunt May walks in.
In a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity. Toomes denies this.

","Section: Cast (1):
Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:A 15-year-old who gained spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Producers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal were impressed by Holland's performances in The Impossible (2012), Wolf Hall (2015), and In the Heart of the Sea (2015). Holland took inspiration from previous Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but also hoped to deliver something ""new and exciting"" with his take on the character, the first to focus on Parker as ""dealing with everyday problems that a 15-year-old deals with as well as trying to save the city."" Holland attended The Bronx High School of Science in the Bronx for a few days to prepare for the role, where other students did not believe he was cast as Spider-Man. Holland felt this would carry over well to the film, where other characters do not suspect Parker of being Spider-Man. It took 25 to 45 minutes for Holland to get into costume, depending on if he had to wear a stunt harness underneath the suit. Holland initially signed for six MCU films, including three Spider-Man films.
Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture:A salvager-turned-arms-trafficker after his company is forced out of business. He uses a suit with mechanical wings forged from Chitauri technology. Toomes is revealed to be the father of Liz, Parker's love interest. Director Jon Watts wanted him to be a ""regular guy"", closer to John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) than other MCU villains like Thanos and Ultron, to go with Spider-Man as a ""regular kid who becomes a superhero"". This helped avoid Toomes drawing the attention of the Avengers, and provided someone that Parker would be able to defeat while still learning to use his abilities. Keaton said Toomes was not completely villainous, as ""there's parts of him that you go, 'You know what? I might see his point.'"" Co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll likened Toomes to ""the dark Tony Stark"", a ""businessman with a family. He wants to look out for his kids ... He doesn't have these big delusions of grandeur where he wants to take over the world, or replace the government, or even defeat the Avengers or anything. He just wants his shot at the good life."" Keaton was not hesitant to portray another comic book character after playing Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 film and its 1992 sequel.
Jon Favreau as Harold ""Happy"" Hogan:The former head of security for Stark Industries and Tony Stark's driver and bodyguard. Hogan is ""looking after"" Parker in the film, with Favreau saying that Parker ""needs someone to help him out"". Favreau previously portrayed Hogan in the Iron Man films, having also directed the first two of those, and described returning as just an actor as fun, allowing him ""to maintain the relationship with the MCU ... Especially when the filmmakers are taking care of you, and taking care of the characters and the story.""
Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Tony Stark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.
Zendaya as Michelle:One of Parker's classmates, also known as ""MJ"". Zendaya, calling her awkward but intellectual, said that ""she just feels like she doesn't need to talk to people"" because of her intelligence. She added that it was ""refreshing"" that Michelle was weird and different, feeling that ""a lot of young people—especially young women—can relate to that."" Watts likened the character to Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from The Breakfast Club (1985) or Linda Cardellini's Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks (1999–2000). The character is not a direct adaptation of Mary Jane Watson, but was given the initials ""MJ"" to ""remind you of that dynamic"", with the writers ""plant[ing] the seeds in this movie"" for comparisons to Watson, but also making her ""wholly different"". Feige added that Michelle is ""not obsessed with"" Parker like Watson is at times in the comics, ""she's just observant"".
Donald Glover as Aaron Davis:A criminal looking to purchase weapons from Toomes. Davis is the uncle of Miles Morales, a version of Spider-Man, in the comics. Glover voiced Morales in the Ultimate Spider-Man television series, and campaigned to portray Spider-Man in a film in 2010. Watts was aware of the campaign, and as soon as he was hired he asked Feige about casting Glover. The role was designed as ""a surprise treat for fans"", with Davis mentioning his nephew to set up Morales potentially appearing in a future MCU film.
Jacob Batalon as Ned:Parker's best friend, who is a ""complete gamer"". Batalon described him as ""the quintessential best guy, the best man, the number two guy, the guy in the chair"" for Parker. Marvel used Ned Leeds as a basis for the character, who does not have a last name in the script or film, but essentially created their own character with him. Carroll said that Ned and other characters in the film are composites of several of their favorites from Spider-Man comics, notably Ganke Lee, who is Miles Morales' best friend in Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man. He was given the last name ""Leeds"" in the sequel, but this was not a certainty.
Laura Harrier as Liz: A senior, Parker's love interest, and Toomes' daughter, with a ""type-A"" personality.
Tony Revolori as Eugene ""Flash"" Thompson:Parker's rival and classmate. It was noted that the character is generally depicted as a white bully in the comics; the Guatemalan American actor received death threats upon his casting. Revolori worked hard ""to do him justice"", as he is an important character to the fans. Rather than being a physically imposing jock, Thompson was re-imagined as ""a rich, smug kid"" to reflect modern views of bullying, by crafting him more into a social media bully and rival for Parker opposed to a jock; this depiction was largely informed by Holland's visit to The Bronx High School of Science. Revolori said that Thompson has to work hard to match Parker's intelligence, which is ""one of the reasons he doesn't like Peter. Everyone else seems to like Peter, so he's like, why don't they like me like they like him?"" Revolori gained 60 lb (27 kg) for the role.
Bokeem Woodbine as Herman Schultz / Shocker II: An accomplice of Toomes' who uses modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Crossbones' gauntlets.
Tyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag: The head of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.
Marisa Tomei as May Parker:Peter's aunt. First reports of Tomei's casting caused backlash on social media, with comic book fans opining that the actress was ""too young and attractive to portray the character"", especially after the character had previously been depicted by actresses older than Tomei. Regarding the casting, Captain America: Civil War co-writer Stephen McFeely said that, for the MCU, they were trying to make Peter ""as naturalistic as possible...That's partly why his aunt isn't 80 years old; if she's the sister of his dead mother, why does she have to be two generations ahead?"" Carroll added that the creative team was looking for more of a ""big sister"" or someone closer in age to Peter Parker in the casting process. After researching the character, Tomei did make ""a case to age me up, but no they didn't do it"". Tomei felt there was a ""blank slate"" from which she could develop the character, and talked to Watts about May being ""a community organizer or invested in the neighborhood"" to indicate where Peter's values come from.
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention who is Parker's mentor and the creator of the U.S. Department of Damage Control. Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in Captain America: Civil War. Watts noted that after Stark's actions in Civil War, introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are ""a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?"" Co-writer Jonathan Goldstein compared Stark to Ethan Hawke's father character in Boyhood (2014).Additionally, Kerry Condon and Chris Evans reprise their roles as F.R.I.D.A.Y. and Steve Rogers / Captain America from previous MCU films, respectively. Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school. Garcelle Beauvais portrays Doris Toomes, Adrian's wife and Liz's mother, and Jennifer Connelly provides the voice of Karen, the A.I. in Parker's suit. Hemky Madera appears as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, while Gary Weeks portrays Damage Control agent Foster. Logan Marshall-Green plays Jackson Brice, the first Shocker, who is an accomplice of Toomes' who uses modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Crossbones' gauntlets. Other business partners of Toomes' include: Michael Chernus as Phineas Mason / Tinkerer, Michael Mando as Mac Gargan, and Christopher Berry as Randy.Faculty at Parker's high school include: Kenneth Choi, who previously played Jim Morita in the MCU, as Jim's descendant Principal Morita; Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, the school's gym teacher, who he described as ""one of the dumbass characters that don't realize [Parker is] Spider-Man""; Martin Starr, who reprises his previously unnamed role from The Incredible Hulk (2008), as Mr. Harrington, a teacher and academic decathlon coach; Selenis Leyva as Ms. Warren; Tunde Adebimpe as Mr. Cobbwell; and John Penick as Mr. Hapgood. Parker's classmates include: Isabella Amara as Sally; Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello; J. J. Totah as Seymour; Abraham Attah as Abraham; Tiffany Espensen as Cindy; Angourie Rice as Betty Brant; Michael Barbieri as Charles; and Ethan Dizon as Tiny. Martha Kelly appears in the film as a tour guide, and Kirk Thatcher makes a cameo appearance as a ""punk"", an homage to his role in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, as a New York City apartment resident named Gary who witnesses Parker's confrontation with a neighbor.

Following the November 2014 hacking of Sony's computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released, stating that Sony wanted Marvel Studios to produce a new trilogy of Spider-Man films while Sony retained ""creative control, marketing and distribution"". Discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, and Sony planned to proceed with its own slate of Spider-Man films. However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that they would release a new Spider-Man film, with Kevin Feige and Pascal producing (the latter through her company Pascal Pictures). The character would first appear in an earlier Marvel Cinematic Universe film, later revealed to be Captain America: Civil War. Marvel Studios would explore opportunities to integrate MCU characters into future Spider-Man films, which Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, and have final creative control over. Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175 million to Sony and paying up to $35 million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous 5% of a Spider-Man film's revenue—Marvel could now reduce their $35 million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750 million. Marvel Studios still received 5% of first dollar gross for the film. Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal, covering 25% of the $175 million budget, while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios. Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.Marvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they announced their slate of Phase Three films, with Feige saying, ""Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [the deal] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [the Spider-Man film] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three."" Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for The Amazing Spider-Man series, were set to serve as executive producers, with neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield returning for the new film. Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man, with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners. In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film, while O'Brien said he had not been approached for the role. Goddard, who was previously attached to a Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he ""didn't really have an idea"" for it and struggled with the idea of working on a new film after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset. The next month, while promoting Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film, which would not be an origin story, since ""there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [thirteen years, so] we are going to take it for granted that people know that, and the specifics"". Parker's Uncle Ben is still referenced in the film, but not by name. Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man, with Holland and Butterfield the front-runners.In May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, the writing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being considered to direct the film. Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for ""chemistry"". The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers—the directors of Captain America: Civil War. By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration, while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man, and that Watts would direct the film. The Russo's ""were pretty vocal about who [sic] [they] wanted for the part"", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film. He was able to ""see what they were doing with it"" and provide ""ideas about this and that"", including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like ""so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs"". On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said he was excited to explore the ""ground level"" of the MCU, a world where characters like the Avengers exist but have only been depicted in previous films at ""the Penthouse level of the Marvel world"".Before getting the job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early ""mood reels"" saying, ""I don't know what the situation would be, but that would be a person he'd want to get in trouble with."" Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that ""at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death"". He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was ""diametrically opposed"" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the ""drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man"". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley said the film was about Parker ""finding his place"" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him ""coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses"", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, ""Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie."" The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as ""the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington, D.C."" One of the first sequences they pitched was ""seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?"" The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, ""low-stakes"" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the ""big guys"".Marvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, ""When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker."" Inspired by their experiences working on sit-coms, the writers also looked to create ""a network of strong characters"" to surround Parker with in the film. In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Can't Buy Me Love (1987), Say Anything... (1989), and Almost Famous (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre. It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations. Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and ""came to a new realization"" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established ""a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it"". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film, since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU. Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were Ultimate Spider-Man and Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane. In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.

Watts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For Homecoming, Watts worked with a team to ""figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before"" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the ""web-slinging"" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big ""swoopy"" camera moves that had been previously used and instead ""keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.""In January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date to July 7, 2017, and said the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D in post-production. J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker. The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear, and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover. He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with ""good faith"" in order ""to have more toys to play with as we put together a story"", and that ""the agreement was that it is very much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in [Civil War], and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting."" Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel. At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming, a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character ""coming home"" to Marvel and the MCU. Tony Revolori – who had auditioned for Peter Parker – and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's, and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark. Watts noted that Stark ""was always a part of"" the films' story because of his interactions with Parker in Civil War.Also in April, Michael Keaton entered talks to play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly thereafter due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast as a friend of Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as ""one of [the] most diverse places in the world"", with Feige adding that ""we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [With this cast] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue."" This is also different from the previous films, which were ""set in a lily-white Queens high school"". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included the Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, ""We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary."" This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials ""MJ"" as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is ""to have fun with [references] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic"".Spider-Man's costume in the film has more technical improvements than the previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an AI system similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S., a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, and the ability to augment reality with the eye pieces. Stark also builds in a ""training wheels"" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and ""pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did"" to include in the Homecoming suit. Spider-Man's web shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of Civil War, which Carroll explained allowed him to ""adjust the spray"" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.

Section: Filming (2):
Principal photography began on June 20, 2016, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, under the working title Summer of George. Salvatore Totino served as director of photography. Filming also took place in Atlanta, with locations including Grady High School, Downtown Atlanta, the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, Piedmont Park, the Georgia World Congress Center, and the West End neighborhood. Holland said building New York sets in Atlanta was cheaper than actually filming in New York, a location closely associated with the character, though the production may ""end up [in New York] for one week or two"". A replica of the Staten Island Ferry was built in Atlanta, with the ability to open and close in half in 10 to 12 seconds and be flooded with 40,000 gallons of water in 8 seconds. Additional filming also occurred at two magnet schools in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles.Casting continued after the start of production, with the inclusion of Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., J. J. Totah, Hannibal Buress, Selenis Leyva, Abraham Attah, Michael Mando, Tyne Daly, Garcelle Beauvais, Tiffany Espensen, and Angourie Rice in unspecified roles, with Bokeem Woodbine joining as an additional villain. At San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly, and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, Liz Allan, and Flash Thompson, respectively, and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned. It was also revealed that the Vulture would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay, from Goldstein and Daley's story. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as ""really fun and funny"", and said that they ""sort of established the broad strokes of the movie"", with him and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a ""pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be."" McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as ""it's all a little bit flexible when you get to set. You try things out, and you just need someone to be writing while you're shooting.""Harrier noted that the young actors in the film ""constantly refer to ourselves as The Breakfast Club"". Shortly after, Martha Kelly joined the cast in an unspecified role. In August, Michael Chernus was cast as Phineas Mason / Tinkerer, while Jona Xiao joined the cast in an unspecified role, and Buress said he was playing a gym teacher. By September 2016, Jon Favreau was reprising his role as Happy Hogan from the Iron Man series, and filming concluded in Atlanta and moved to New York City. Locations in the latter area included Astoria, Queens, St. George, Staten Island, Manhattan, and Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn. Additionally, UFC fighter Tyron Woodley said he had been considered for a villain role in the film, but had to drop out due to a prior commitment with Fox Sports. Principal photography wrapped on October 2, 2016, in New York City, with some additional filming taking place later in the month in Berlin, Germany, near the Brandenburg Gate.

Section: Post-production (2):
In November 2016, Feige confirmed that Keaton would play Adrian Toomes / Vulture, while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker. In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing re-shoots, and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video. Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, about ""just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it"". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film. Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt ""just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell"" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use ""to drive the story"".The film features multiple post-credit scenes. The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this ""was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family."" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a meta-referential joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a ""last-minute addition"" to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, ""You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to."" That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.In July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige ""wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time"". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, ""We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem."" Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, ""What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique."" Goldstein added that it ""diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life."" Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team ""worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field"". Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, ""more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff"". Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were ""giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time.""

Section: Visual effects (3):
Visual effects for the film were completed by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Digital Domain, Cantina Creative, Iloura, Trixter, and Industrial Light & Magic. Executive producer Victoria Alonso initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on Homecoming, in order to give it a different look than those earlier films. She changed her mind after seeing what she called ""phenomenal"" test material from the vendor.Trixter contributed over 300 shots for the film, including the opening scene at Grand Central Terminal, the sequence that retells the events of Civil War from Parker's perspective, the sequence where Toomes takes Liz and Parker to the dance, the school battle between Parker and Schultz, and the scene around and within the Avengers compound. They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle and cloth system to it ""to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit"". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in Homecoming. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by Framestore for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was ""to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated"".Digital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to LIDAR an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version. Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence ""brutal"" because ""the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day."" Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film, when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them ""based on a maquete"". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by Adaptiv IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by BAE Systems, which ""uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared"". For their web design, which was based on the one created for Civil War, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the Civil War webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which ""the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things."" For this film, they ""dialed back the barbs"" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film. Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating with an average score of 7.70/10, based on 391 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% ""definite recommend"".Sara Stewart of the New York Post praised the film as ""an endearingly awkward kid brother to the glamorous Wonder Woman"", attributing much of the ""heavy-lifting"" to Holland's performance and the ""perfectly cast"" Keaton. She also noted Watts' focus on Parker's human side. Mike Ryan at Uproxx felt Homecoming was the best Spider-Man film yet, specifically praising the light tone, younger and more optimistic portrayal of Parker, and Keaton's performance—Ryan named the Vulture twist reveal as one of his favorite scenes in the MCU. He said Homecoming is ""the kind of movie you leave and you're just in the best mood—and still will be days later."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film unique and refreshing, praising its lower stakes and focus on the character's school life. He praised Holland as ""terrific and well-cast"", as well as the other cast members; Roeper believed that Keaton's performance is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been. Owen Gleiberman of Variety felt the film was ""just distinctive enough"" from the previous Spider-Man films to become a ""sizable hit"", and highlighted its focus on making Peter Parker a realistically youthful and grounded character. He found Holland to be likeable in the role, and thought the Vulture twist was a positive direction for that character. He did criticize the vague take on Spider-Man's origin and powers, but ""the flying action has a casual flip buoyancy, and the movie does get you rooting for Peter."" At IndieWire, David Ehrlich criticized the film's superhero genre clichés and underwritten female characters, but praised the elements of the film that leaned into Parker's high school life and the humanity of the Vulture.Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the ""juvenile"" depiction of Parker and Watts' ""unevenly orchestrated"" direction, but feeling that the film ""finds its pace and rhythm by the end"" and praising Keaton's performance. The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore found the film to be ""occasionally exciting but often frustrating"", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as ""winning"" despite the script, and called Zendaya a scene-stealer. Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film was a ""pretty good Spider-Man movie"" that ""breaks no new ground"", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling. At The Telegraph, Robbie Collin argued that ""a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade."" Collin criticized Watts' direction, but was positive of the cast, including Holland, Keaton, Tomei, and Zendaya.

Principal photography began on November 11, 2015, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The film premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 26, 2016, and was released in the United States on January 20, 2017, by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews, with McAvoy's performance earning high praise and some critics labeling it a welcome return to form for Shyamalan, although some criticized the film for its perceived stigmatization of mental illness. The film grossed $278 million worldwide on a budget of $9 million.
The film is a standalone sequel to the 2000 film Unbreakable, which was also written, produced and directed by Shyamalan. The film was not marketed as a sequel, and was a stealth sequel, instead saving the revelation for a scene featuring Bruce Willis reprising his Unbreakable role in an uncredited cameo. Split is noted as the first solo supervillain origin movie. It is also Shyamalan's first sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled Glass, was released in January 2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.","Section: Plot (1):
Just outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Casey Cooke, a withdrawn teenager, is attending the birthday party of her classmate Claire Benoit at the King of Prussia Mall. Claire tells her father that she only invited Casey because she was inviting the entire class and didn't want to leave one person out; Claire reveals Casey is a loner in school and always acts out in class. Casey accepts a ride home from Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, a man suffering from dissociative identity disorder (DID) knocks Claire's father unconscious and enters the car, spraying the girls with an aerosol can of sleeping gas and kidnapping them.
The man, who was named Kevin at birth, is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities formed due to childhood abuse and abandonment. The dominant personality, ""Barry"", controls when and which of the others can manifest. Recently, ""Barry"" has not allowed ""Dennis"" or ""Patricia"" to have control due to his tendency to harass young girls and her belief in a mysterious entity called ""The Beast"" who plans to rid the world of the ""impure"", those who have not suffered. Fletcher recognizes in their sessions that ""Dennis"" has recently displaced ""Barry"" as the dominant personality and is pretending to be him. 
""Dennis"" is the personality that kidnaps and imprisons the girls in an underground cell. He then shifts into a female personality ""Patricia"", entering wearing a dress, and a child personality ""Hedwig"". The girls realize that their abductor has multiple personalities. The girls find an opening to a vent in the ceiling, and Claire escapes through the vents, before being discovered hiding in a locker. She is locked in a storage room separate from Casey and Marcia. In a second escape attempt, Marcia hits ""Patricia"" with a chair when she is distracted and tries to make a run for it, before she is cornered and locked in another isolated cell. By taking advantage of ""Hedwig"", the personality of a nine-year-old boy, Casey attempts to escape and manages to find a walkie-talkie but her attempts to obtain help are dismissed as a prank. Fletcher visits the man's quarters, where he reveals that he has met ""The Beast"", in reality a yet-to-manifest 24th personality. Fletcher realizes that there is an internal conflict between the personalities and becomes concerned that ""Dennis"" kidnapped the girls in order to sacrifice them to ""the Beast"". She fakes going to the bathroom and finds Claire locked in the storage room. ""Dennis"" appears and sedates Fletcher. ""Dennis"" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows ""The Beast"", who has enhanced physical abilities, to take over. Fletcher writes a letter with the man's full name ""Kevin Wendell Crumb"", on a piece of paper before ""The Beast"" arrives and kills her by crushing her torso. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that ""The Beast"" has already killed and eaten some of Marcia and sees him attack Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. ""The Beast"" approaches her, scaling the walls, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.
This prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control and ""Patricia"" is the victor. Casey is told that ""Kevin"" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. They once again let ""The Beast"" take hold. Casey retrieves the shotgun and cartridges before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots ""The Beast"" twice causing only minor wounds. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars ""The Beast"" begins to pull apart. He sees faded scars across her body. Highlighted by flashbacks throughout the film, this reveals that she had been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John, before and after her father's demise. ""Dennis"" considers Casey to be ""pure"" and more evolved due to her being ""broken"", and spares her.
Casey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the Philadelphia Zoo, where her captor had been an employee. When Casey is asked by the police if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she just stares darkly. In another hideout, ""Dennis"", ""Patricia"", and ""Hedwig"" discuss the power of ""The Beast"" and their plans to change the world. In Silk City Diner, several patrons watch a news report on The Beast's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname ""The Horde"". A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname. As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, David Dunn, says it was ""Mr. Glass"".

Shyamalan conceived the idea for Split years before he wrote the screenplay. He explained, ""In this case I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me. It sat there for a long time, and I really don't have a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier. But this felt like the perfect time to do it, with the type of movies I'm doing now, and the type of tones I am interested in – humor and suspense.""On October 2, 2015, James McAvoy was cast in the film to play the lead, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. On October 12, 2015, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley, Jessica Sula, and Haley Lu Richardson were added to the cast. On October 27, 2015, Universal Pictures came on board to release the film and titled it as Split.The character of Kevin had been in one of the early drafts of Shyamalan's Unbreakable, but he had pulled the character out, stating there were balancing issues at that time. With Split, he brought in some of the scenes he had written for Unbreakable around Kevin. The film ends with the appearance of Bruce Willis's character, David Dunn, from Unbreakable, who makes a comment in reference to the previous film, placing Unbreakable and Split within the same narrative universe. Shyamalan requested permission to incorporate the character from Walt Disney Studios, which had produced Unbreakable. Shyamalan met with Sean Bailey about the use of the character; they came to a gentlemen's agreement where Bailey agreed to allow the use of the character in the film without a fee and Shyamalan promised that Disney would be involved in a sequel, if developed. Shyamalan was very secretive of Willis' involvement in Split, removing the final scene from the film for test audiences. The cameo was shown at the 2016 Fantastic Fest and 2016 AFI Fest months before its theatrical release.As with The Visit, Shyamalan funded the film himself. Principal photography on the film began on November 11, 2015, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Reshoots occurred in June 2016. During post-production, Sterling K. Brown's role as Shaw, Dr. Fletcher's neighbor, was cut from the film, as Shyamalan felt that his scenes were ultimately unnecessary. McAvoy broke his hand in a scene where he was supposed to punch a metal door, but missed the soft section of the door he intended to hit.

Night Shyamalan returning resoundingly to thrilling form."" Metacritic reports a weighted average score 62 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews."" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, while comScore reported filmgoers gave it a 78% overall positive score and a 54% ""definite recommend.""Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five, stating it to be a ""masterful blend of Hitchcock, horror and therapy session"". Also writing for The Guardian, Steve Rose had strong praise for McAvoy, opining that the actor ""does a fine and fearless job of selling his character's varied personae"". He commended McAvoy's ability to switch personalities in one scene toward the end of the film, saying: ""It's a little like the T-1000 at the end of Terminator 2. But there are no special effects here, just acting.""The film has been referred to as the first supervillain origin story; the first time a film has been completely devoted to the origins of a villain as opposed to the origins of the superhero. It has been described as Hollywood's first stealth sequel, with The Hollywood Reporter calling it ""one of the most shocking surprises in cinematic history"".

Section: Reaction in the mental health community (2):
The film has been poorly received in the mental illness and dissociative identity disorder communities. Mental health advocates warn that the film stigmatizes dissociative identity disorder and may directly affect those living with it. ""You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate symptoms in thousands of people who are already suffering,"" psychiatrist Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only ""the most extreme aspects"" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of mental health that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some psychiatrists, she said.
Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks Split is having a larger effect on younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as Psycho and Identity, that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that Split may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID.In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in jail over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. And in an open letter to the director, several Plural Activists said ""Split represents yet another gross parody of us based on fear, ignorance and sensationalism, only much worse.""Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based psychologist and psychoanalyst, said he had not seen the movie — and doesn’t plan to. “What concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a disorder that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering — the abuse of innocent children,” Itzkowitz told Healthline. He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don’t know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories “vilify and demonize mental illness in general, and DID in particular,” the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.

",,"Netflix’s Squared Love is a Polish rom-com tha- wait, “Squared Love”? Is something lost in that title’s Polski-to-English translation? Maybe it has something to do with the premise, in which a mousy schoolteacher has a secret life as a mega-glamor model — you know, she’s a square but also super hot? Or it’s a variation on the usual rom-com formula, which frequently depicts relationships that are, you know, love triangled? (Triangulated? Trianglematized?) Anyway, I was going to say it’s indebted to many silly-premise American movies that came before it, which isn’t inherently a bad thing, because if it has charm, that trumps all, and possibly allows it to leap the considerable hurdle of bearing a befuddling title. The Gist: Enzo (Mateusz Banasiuk) is not really Enzo. He’s actually Stefan, but the world knows him as Enzo, the celebrity model who cruises the city in fancy sports cars, using his sexy smirk to pick upWhat Movies Will It Remind You Of?: I haven’t been this unconvinced by a ridiculous secret-identity plot since Hannah Montana: The Movie.

Performance Worth Watching: Chlebicka brings a degree of sincerity to this dual-personality role, but the screenplay only gives her cliches to work with.

Memorable Dialogue: “Real love is always squared,” Monika’s dad says, casting not a single ray of illumination on the title’s meaning

Sex and Skin: Smooching only.

Our Take: Sorry, but Monika/Klaudia’s Superman routine is unconvincing. And corny. And burdened by weary stereotypes. Maybe it’d work if the film struck a more bubbly, absurdist or self-aware tone, but it takes itself about 10 percent too seriously, and struggles to find its comedic feet. In a quest for laughs, director Filip Zylber strikes his share of off-key notes — e.g., the scene in which Enzo and Klaudia first meet, on the way to a modeling shoot, when he picks her up after her car breaks down, and he jokes that she’s a prostitute just like the women across the street, even though they’re on a rural road surrounded by forest, which is where prostitutes apparently hang out in Poland? Is this funny? Or plausible? Even remotely? You know the answer to that.

The screenplay is a cluttered and repetitive thing moving with leaden boots. Maybe it’s good that it takes the time to let us get to know the characters, but with no balance of pacing and development and minimal chemistry between the leads, it’s a drag. The plot tosses out pointless complications — including that old chestnut, the Child With a Life-Threatening Allergy — that feel like slow-motion contortions Monika and Enzo must navigate to get to the inevitable conclusion, as dictated by TIFOD. It’s not a film y women. Klaudia (Adrianna Chlebicka) is not really Klaudia. She’s actually Monika, a teacher who ditches her zip-up denim jumper and big eyeglasses for spike heels, short skirts, fake lashes, contact lenses and a curly wig to moonlight as Klaudia, the celebrity model who’s on billboards all over town. The third primary character in the movie is The Invisible Force Of Destiny (TIFOD), played by screenwriters Marzanna Polit and Wiktor Piatkowski, a nebulous presence conspiring to press Enzo/Stefan and Klaudia/Monika’s lips together.

It doesn’t happen so easily, though, because The Invisible Force Of Destiny has a sense of humor and also has to fill 100 or so minutes of movie run time. Occasionally, TIFOD steps back to allow for character development: Enzo lives with Alicja (Agnieszka Zulewska), a managerial sort at the ad firm that employs him. She’s a harsh personality who clearly values her gigantic dog over him, and even though they have an open relationship, she’s not happy that he takes advantage of it so frequently. She kicks him out, forcing him to move in with his brother (Krzysztof Czeczot) and young niece Ania (Helena Mazur).

Klaudia hustles from glossy photo shoots to her chaotic classroom, which makes Kindergarten Cop look like Romper Room on barbiturates. Her principal (Tomasz Karolak) is a hardass who dislikes her despite her beloved status, and has a big hard-on for standardized test scores. Monika hates the modeling gig, but puts up with it so she can pay off her father’s (Miroslaw Baka) debt — note: he also doesn’t know she’s Klaudia — which is the kind of debt that has heavies grabbing him by the lapels and threatening to break his fingers. Teaching is her TRUE passion, but if the awful TRUTH of her alter-ego is revealed, oh it would be such a SCANDAL, I guess?

And so, TIFOD works to put Klaudia and Enzo on the same project, where they’ll play sex-ay romantic lovers who make out next to and/or atop sports cars. It also conspires to make Enzo take a shine to Ania, who happens to be one of Monika’s students. Notably, Enzo looks like Markus and Markus looks like Enzo, where Monika and Klaudia are two distinctive sides of one woman’s life. They’re both being duplicitous — she’s keeping a secret, and he thinks he’s macking on two different ladeez. There’s a tingle between Enzo and Klaudia on set, and there’s a spark between Enzo and Monika when he chaperones school field trips. Will he ever find out the truth of it all? And will he actually be rewarded for being a two-timing cad? NIE SPOJLERY!",5,2099,"Comedy,Romance",Negative,0.704
101,Sucker Punch,United States ,Legendary Pictures ,Warner Bros. Pictures,Emily Browning Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens Jamie Chung Carla Gugino Oscar Isaac Jon Hamm Scott Glenn,Zack Snyder Steve Shibuya,109,Zack Snyder,82000000,90000000,"Sucker Punch is a 2011 American psychological fantasy action film directed by Zack Snyder and co-written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya. It is Snyder's first film based on an original concept. The film stars Emily Browning as ""Babydoll"", a young woman who is committed to a mental institution and copes by envisioning it as a brothel. She teams up with four dancers/prisoners to escape before her scheduled lobotomy. As she collects the items she needs to escape, she enters another level of fantasy in which the women become strong, experienced warriors. Each fantasy is a parallel to the events in the brothel. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung portray the four prisoners whom Babydoll imagines as dancers. Carla Gugino plays Dr. Vera Gorski, a psychiatrist whom Babydoll imagines as Madame Gorski, a choreographer at the strip club. Oscar Isaac plays Blue Jones, the asylum's orderly; in Babydoll's mind he's the brothel's corrupt owner.
The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres in the United States on March 25, 2011. The film received negative reviews and was a box office failure.","Section: Plot (1):
In the 1960s, a young woman nicknamed Babydoll is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after he murders her younger sister and frames her for the crime. He bribes asylum orderly Blue Jones to forge the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Vera Gorski, to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform authorities of the truth. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.
Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she has newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other patients/dancers: Amber, Blondie, Rocket, and Rocket's sister and ""star of the show"", Sweet Pea. Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller, who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform her lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man. After she expresses her desire to ""escape"", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she needs five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth unrevealed item that only she can find, which would require ""a deep sacrifice"" and bring a ""perfect victory"". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel; her dance has impressed Blue and other onlookers.
Babydoll eventually convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines fantastic adventures that mirror the escape efforts. These adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by steampunk-inspired World War I German soldiers to gain a map (mirrored by Sweet Pea copying a map of the brothel/institution from Blue's office), storming an Orc-infested castle to retrieve two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (mirrored by Amber stealing a lighter from the mayor's pocket), and boarding a train and fighting robotic guards to disarm a bomb (mirrored by Sweet Pea stealing a kitchen knife from the Cook's belt). During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to guarantee Sweet Pea's escape from the bomb's blast, paralleled by the Cook fatally stabbing Rocket as she tries to protect her sister.
Blue overhears Blondie relaying Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming his suspicions that something is amiss. He locks Sweet Pea in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He fatally shoots Amber and Blondie, and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they seek an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where a throng of men blocks their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item she needs is actually her own sacrifice, and that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, Babydoll insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.
Back in the asylum, the surgeon has just performed Babydoll's lobotomy. Gorski notes that during her short stay, the girl stabbed an orderly, started a fire, and helped another girl escape the asylum. The surgeon is baffled by Babydoll's expression, and asks Gorski why she authorized the procedure, and many identical ones before. Gorski realizes that Blue has been forging her signature and summons the police, who apprehend Blue as he attempts to sexually assault a lobotomized Babydoll. While being led away, Blue also incriminates the stepfather. Babydoll is shown smiling serenely.
At a bus station, Sweet Pea, having stolen a dress to better blend in, gets stopped by police as she tries to board a bus to Fort Wayne, but the bus driver (the Wise Man) rescues her by misleading the police and letting her board. She thanks him and he says they have ""a long way to go"" as the bus leaves.
During the end credits, Dr. Gorski and Blue sing ""Love Is the Drug"" as a duet in a glitzy musical sequence that includes dancing from all five female leads.

Section: Development (2):
Sucker Punch is described by Snyder as ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns"". The film first gained attention in March 2007. Snyder put the project aside to work on Watchmen first. The film was co-written with Steve Shibuya, who authored the original script on which the story is based. Snyder directed and produced with his wife and producing partner, Deborah Snyder, through their Cruel and Unusual Films banner. Wesley Coller served as executive producer.Warner Bros. announced in early 2009 that they would distribute Sucker Punch due to the success of Snyder's previous film, Watchmen. ""They've never said, 'Ahh, it could have been shorter', or, 'Too bad it's so R-ish.' And that's really cool. I'm challenging them again with Sucker Punch."" In early interviews, Snyder stated that he would make Sucker Punch an R-rated film, but a later interview stated that he was aiming for it to be rated PG-13. In its theatrical release, the movie was ultimately rated PG-13. Snyder cut many crucial scenes before the film's release in order to satisfy the MPAA's censors, but claimed that the home media release of the film will be a director's cut and closer to his original vision.When Snyder was in San Diego hosting a Blu-ray live screening of Watchmen for Comic-Con, he handed out T-shirts for Sucker Punch featuring the first art for the film. The art was designed by Alex Pardee of Snafu Comics, with title art work by Los Angeles graffiti artist Galo Canote. Pre-production began in June 2009 in Canada. Snyder had also added that he enjoyed the freedom of filming his own original script. Photographer Clay Enos was hired to take still pictures on set and to take portraits of the main actors.

Section: Casting (2):
Before casting started in March 2009, Snyder revealed his ideal cast for the feature film. He chose to go with an all-female cast in this film saying that ""I already did the all-male cast with 300, so I'm doing the opposite end of the spectrum.""Snyder had tapped Amanda Seyfried first for the lead role, Babydoll. When asked if Seyfried was up for the role, Snyder said, ""We'll see. We're trying to, so ... She's great. It would be great if it worked out"". Snyder had also offered roles to Abbie Cornish, Evan Rachel Wood, Emma Stone, and Vanessa Hudgens. However, Seyfried turned it down due to a conflict in schedule with her HBO series Big Love. Browning agreed to replace Seyfried in the role. During the confirmation of her involvement, Hudgens, Wood, Cornish, and Stone were all still in talks. According to Brie Larson in a 2020 video on YouTube when discussing for the second time the films she said auditioned for she mentioned Sucker Punch.Wood dropped out of the project due to scheduling conflicts with her recurring role in HBO's True Blood and her stage production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. She was later replaced by Malone for the role of ""Rocket"". Chung was signed up to play ""Amber""; Emma Stone had been offered the part but declined due schedule conflict with her film Easy A. Freida Pinto was also considered for the role of ""Amber"" before it went to Jamie Chung. Gugino, who was cast as ""Madam Gorski"", a psychiatrist in the asylum, previously worked with Snyder on Watchmen. Hamm was confirmed in late August 2009 to play ""The High Roller"". Isaac was also tapped at around the same time. Snyder confirmed that Glenn agreed to be involved in the project, portraying ""The Wise Man"".

Section: Training (2):
Prior to filming, the cast had twelve weeks of training and fight evaluations, beginning in June 2009 in Los Angeles and continuing through filming. The leads in the film were trained to deadlift up to 250 pounds (110 kg) for their roles. Damon Caro, the stunt coordinator and fight choreographer from 300 and Watchmen, Snyder's previous films, was hired for the action design, stunt training and fight choreography for the movie. The other cast members started training without Hudgens while she was involved with other projects, including Beastly. Abbie Cornish said that the rest of the cast were training six hours a day, five days a week in martial arts, swords and empty hand choreography. Jena Malone has stated that her daily routine comprised four hours of warmups and mixed martial arts wushu training, then three hours of weight training, then firearms training and tactical positioning, and then pole-dancing lessons. Snyder said that when the girls are fighting, ""[like] they're on their way to kill a baby dragon, they've killed all of these orc-like creatures and they're entering a door [and] it's this classic, real Navy SEAL style room clearing. They have machine guns but they're fighting mythic creatures, impossible creatures. The hand to hand stuff is all brutal, because Damon [Caro] did all the [fights] in Bourne and it has that vibe to it."" Snyder remarks that in the girls' imaginations ""they can do anything"".

Section: Production and design (2):
Pre-production began in Los Angeles in June 2009 then moved to Vancouver in July. Principal photography began in September 2009 in Vancouver, and concluded in January 2010. With an $82 million budget, post-production began in September 2009 and was expected to last until January 2010 in Vancouver and Toronto. Originally, production would have started in June 2009, but it was postponed. Production concluded on January 22, 2010. Snyder confirmed that prior to the set production date, he already shot some fantasy sequences for Sucker Punch. Snyder said the film is a ""stylized motion picture about action and sort of landscapes of the imagination and things of that nature"". Snyder had also been decided on the film's title for some time, stating it is a pop-culture reference. ""It's about hopefully what the movie feels like when you watch it, more than a specific 'Oh, it's a story of this person.' It's all stylized.""The film includes an imaginary brothel that the five girls enter in the alternate reality, where singing and dancing take place. The fantasy sequences include dragons, aliens, and a World War I battle. Snyder expressed his interest in the film's content:

On the other hand, though it's fetishistic and personal, I like to think that my fetishes aren't that obscure. Who doesn't want to see girls running down the trenches of World War One wreaking havoc? I'd always had an interest in those worlds – comic books, fantasy art, animated films. I'd like to see this, that's how I approach everything, and then keep pushing it from there.
Rick Carter served as production designer while the visual effects of the film were done by Animal Logic with 75 visual effects specialists, and the Moving Picture Company (MPC) who were awarded over 120 shots. Sucker Punch operates on three levels – a reality, then a sub-reality where the psych ward world shifts into a strange high-roller's brothel. The final level is made up of a dream world where more action sequences that are removed from time and space take place. Warner Bros. announced earlier that Sucker Punch would be released in 3D format. Snyder describes the conversion into 3D as a completely different process. However, it was later announced that the film would not be presented in 3D. Snyder filmed a ""Maximum Movie Mode"" interactive Blu-ray commentary for the film's home media release.Snyder wanted to design the film as something with no limits, considering that he co-wrote the script from an original idea. He added that he wanted it to ""be a cool story and not just like a video game where you're just loose and going nuts."" Snyder also noted the influence of Asian iconography, particularly Japanese elements such as samurai, anime, and mecha.

Section: Title (2):
The title Sucker Punch is not explained in the film. Snyder has said that there are two meanings:There's a mechanism in the movie that sneaks up on you. We sort of plant the seed of this thing, and then at the end of the movie it kind of comes back around. I think that in some ways, that's what the sucker punch is. But also you, the audience, have like a preconceived idea when you look at Babydoll. You think she's innocent and sweet, that she's capable of only a certain amount of things. But I think that's a mistake. So that has something to do with the title, too.
Andrew O'Hehir, writing in Salon, sees the film's title as its essential theme:If you want to understand Snyder's central narrative gambit, it's right there in the title. He gives us what we want (or what we think we want, or what he thinks we think we want): Absurdly fetishized women in teeny little skirts, gloriously repetitious fight sequences loaded with plot coupons, pseudo-feminist fantasies of escape and revenge. Then he yanks it all back and stabs us through the eyeball.
Snyder has stated one interpretation of the film is that it is a critique of geek culture's sexism and objectification of women.

Section: Music and dance (2):
Music plays an integral role in the film. ""In the story, music is the thing that launches them into these fantasy worlds"", Snyder explains. Composer Tyler Bates said that the songs ""function as the subconscious mind of Baby Doll and her journey"", and musical producer Marius de Vries considered ""an important task of the songs to signplace which particular world you are inhabiting at a particular moment"". Music becomes the backbone of the film. They used actual songs for Sucker Punch that would create suitable moods. It plays an important factor in the film and is used as it was in Moulin Rouge!, according to Snyder. Dance choreography was spearheaded by Paul Becker. Emily Browning did the vocals for the songs ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Asleep"" and ""Where Is My Mind"" that are played during the movie. Carla Gugino had to take singing lessons for her scenes as a choreographer madam in the brothel. The brothel scenario has ""sexy"" songs, as Jamie Chung described, and dance fantasy scenes. Due to time constraints, Snyder was forced to cut most of the dance sequences for the theatrical release of the film, but there is one during the credits. He did mention that for the home media release of the film's ""director's cut"", the dance scenes will be re-inserted.In September 2009, Chung reported that they had begun recording tracks for Sucker Punch. Oscar Isaac said the songs used in the film are not original, but are new arrangements of existing music.Tyler Bates (who composed all of Snyder's previous live-action films) and Marius de Vries (who composed the score for the film Moulin Rouge!) co-wrote the film score. The official trailers contain samples from the songs ""Prologue"" by Immediate Music, ""Crablouse"" by Lords of Acid, ""When the Levee Breaks"" by Led Zeppelin, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" by The Beatles, ""And Your World Will Burn"" by Cliff Lin, ""Panic Switch"" by the Silversun Pickups, and ""Illusion of Love"" (Fred Falke remix) by Uffie.
Sucker Punch: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on March 22, 2011 by WaterTower Music. It contained nine tracks, all covers, remixes, and mash-ups (as the label website says, ""wildly re-imagined versions of classic songs"") of tracks by Alison Mosshart, Björk, Queen, and performances from stars Emily Browning, Carla Gugino, and Oscar Isaac. The album was praised by music and film critics, as were Browning's vocals.

Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 22% of 218 critics have given Sucker Punch positive reviews, giving it an average rating of 4.2/10. The consensus states: ""It's technically impressive and loaded with eye-catching images, but without characters or a plot to support them, all of Sucker Punch's visual thrills are for naught."" The film holds a 33 out of 100 on Metacritic, signifying ""generally unfavorable"" reviews among 29 critics.Although Snyder had claimed that he wanted the film to ""be a cool story and not just like a video game where you're just loose and going nuts"", some critics compared the film unfavorably to a video game in their reviews. Richard Roeper gave the film a D, saying that it ""proves a movie can be loud, action-packed and filled with beautiful young women – and still bore you to tears."" The Orlando Sentinel gave the movie one out of four stars calling it ""an unerotic unthrilling erotic thriller in the video game mold"". The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin wrote, ""with its quests to retrieve magical totems, clearly demarcated levels, and non-stop action, Snyder's clattering concoction sometimes feels less like a movie than an extended, elaborate trailer for its redundant videogame adaptation."" Reviewing it for The Sydney Morning Herald, Giles Hardie called the film ""incredibly ambitious"", and explained that while ""traditional depths of character development and motivation are sidelined, [...] this is intentional, allowing the audience to immerse in the layers of dreams and later piece together what actually happened"".British film critic Mark Kermode described the film as ""the most boring, ploddingly put together, infantile, crass, adolescent, stupid, chauvinistic twaddle that I've sat through in a very, very long time.""Legendary Pictures reportedly attributed the movie's failure to become a box office hit to movie audiences not accepting a female action hero.Not all reviews were negative, however. Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named Sucker Punch the tenth-best title of 2011: ""This excessive digi-satire spits in the face of fanboys-'n'-their-franchises."" Sonny Bunch hailed the movie as an ""exciting, entertaining piece of work, one that subverts your expectations even as it plays to your presumptions."" In a 2018 article for Oscilloscope Laboratories, Sheila O'Malley wrote favorably of Sucker Punch and described its similarities with the Depression-era musical Gold Diggers of 1933.

Section: Criticism for the depiction of women (2):
Sucker Punch also drew criticism for its depiction of women. Several critics described the film as misogynistic and others expressed concern over its treatment of sexual violence. Monika Bartyzel of Moviefone writes: ""The women of Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch are not empowered. Though they are given vicious snarls, swords and guns, the leading ladies of Snyder's latest are nothing more than cinematic figures of enslavement given only the most minimal fight. Their rebellion is one of imaginative whimsy in a heavily misogynistic world that is barely questioned or truly challenged."" Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune stated that ""Zack Snyder must have known in preproduction that his greasy collection of near-rape fantasies and violent revenge scenarios disguised as a female-empowerment fairy tale wasn't going to satisfy anyone but himself.""St. Petersburg Times critic Steve Persall found that the most offensive fact about the film was that it ""suggests that all this objectification of women makes them stronger. It's supposed to be reassuring that men who beat, berate, molest and kill these women will get what's coming to them. Just wait, Snyder says, but in the meantime here's another femininity insult to keep you occupied."" A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as a ""fantasia of misogyny"" that pretends to be a ""feminist fable of empowerment"" and found that the film's treatment of sexual violence was problematic and believes the target audience as a whole is in favour of it. Peter Debruge of Variety argued that the film is ""misleadingly positioned as female empowerment despite clearly having been hatched as fantasy fodder for 13-year-old guys"" and that the fact that the young women in the movie are ""under constant threat of being raped or murdered"" makes the film ""highly inappropriate for young viewers.""However, Betsy Sharkey of The Los Angeles Times suggested that the film neither objectifies nor empowers women, and is instead a ""wonderfully wild provocation – an imperfect, overlong, intemperate and utterly absorbing romp through the id that I wouldn't have missed for the world."" In a retrospective article about the critical reception of Sucker Punch, James MacDowell questioned the alleged misogyny of the film, arguing that it does not in fact aim to offer female empowerment, but is instead ""a deeply pessimistic analysis of female oppression"", because it makes clear that, ""just as men organize the dances, so do they control the terms of the fight scenes; in neither do the women have true agency, only an illusion of it.""Writing in a separate piece for The A.V. Club months after giving the film a ""C-"" grade, Nathan Rabin concluded, ""Depending on whom you ask, Snyder set out to make either the ultimate sexist masturbatory fanboy fantasy or the ultimate critique of sexist masturbatory fanboy fantasies. He failed spectacularly on both counts, but in true Fiasco form, there's something fascinating and even strangely majestic about that failure.""Scott Mendelsohn of The Huffington Post called the film a ""bitterly sad and angrily feminist mini-epic"", and said that while it presents scenes of ""matter-of-fact lechery from men towards women that is an accepted norm in our society, both then and now"", it ""earns kudos for daring to actually be about something relevant and interesting. It is actually very much about the sexualization of women in popular culture, rather than just using those tools to make pointless exploitation fare."" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict posited that Sucker Punch uses the ""prism of popular culture to say something about the roles that women find themselves forced into—and not just in the fantasies of geeks and fanboys"". Bromley further judged that the film is ""about fighting a losing battle. About using every tool at your disposal, be it sexuality or physical strength or wit or the ability to band together to fight a common enemy—the tool of Sisterhood—and about how that still isn't enough.""In retrospect, Snyder said: “I’m always shocked that it was so badly misunderstood. I always said that it was a commentary on sexism and geek culture. Someone would ask me, “Why did you film the girls this way?” And I’d say, “Well you did!” Sucker Punch is a fuck you to a lot of people who will watch it.”

Pictures,Tom HanksAaron EckhartLaura Linney,Todd Komarnicki,96,Clint Eastwood,60000000,240800000,"Sully (also known as Sully: Miracle on the Hudson) is a 2016 American biographical drama film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Todd Komarnicki, based on the 2009 autobiography Highest Duty by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow. Tom Hanks stars as Sullenberger, with Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan, and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles. The film follows Sullenberger's January 2009 emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, in which all 155 passengers and crew survived—most suffering only minor injuries—and the subsequent publicity and investigation.
Sully premiered at the 43rd Annual Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016, and was released in the United States by Warner Bros. on September 9, 2016, in conventional and IMAX theaters. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $240 million worldwide, but created controversy with its fictionalized portrayal of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as ""prosecutorial and closed-minded."" The American Film Institute and National Board of Review both selected it as one of their ten best films of 2016, and it received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing at the 89th Academy Awards.","Section: Plot (1):
On January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 ft (850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports (Teterboro Airport being the closest), Sully ditches the aircraft on the Hudson River. The crew and passengers evacuate without any fatalities. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him haunted, and experiencing a dream in which the plane crashes into a building.
Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. Furthermore, the National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.
Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been pilot error, which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to divert the plane.
Both simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.

","Section: Production (1):
The film is based on Sully's autobiography Highest Duty, rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass ""that sense of our common humanity"", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: ""People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone a chance to have hope, at a time when we all needed it."" Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: ""It wasn't really a challenge of what to do with the event since that is the thing everyone knows about, it was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way.""By June 2015, it was reported that Tom Hanks was already in talks to play the lead role of Sullenberger. Much of the rest of the cast was announced in August (with Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Holt McCallany, and Jamey Sheridan joining), September (Jerry Ferarra), and October (Max Adler, Sam Huntington, and Wayne Bastrup).Principal photography on the film began on September 28, 2015, in New York City. On October 15, filming started in Atlanta, where a building in downtown Atlanta was transformed into a New York hotel. Most of the film's budget was spent in Los Angeles, where the crash sequence and water evacuation scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios and Universal Studios Hollywood. Filming also took place in North Carolina; Holloman AFB, New Mexico; and Kearny, New Jersey and concluded on April 29, 2016. The film was shot almost entirely with Arri Alexa IMAX cameras. The film was initially going to be framed for IMAX 1.90:1 and protected for 2.39:1, but by the second day of filming, Eastwood said that they were shooting a movie in IMAX and decided to frame for IMAX.
However, the film was released in 2.39 in standard theaters and 1.90 in IMAX.

Sully grossed $125.1 million in the United States and Canada and $115.7 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $240.8 million, against a production budget of $60 million. It broke the September record for biggest global IMAX opening for a 2D film with $5.1 million from 523 IMAX screens, eclipsing the previous record held by The Maze Runner ($4.2 million in 2014). In total it had grossed $10 million in IMAX plays globally.

Section: United States and Canada (3):
In the United States and Canada, Sully was released on Friday, September 9, 2016, across 3,525 theaters, of which 375 were in IMAX, and was initially projected to make $25 million on its opening weekend, with Box Office Mojo projecting $31 million due to its large theater count and positioning. Box office trackers were expecting Sully to launch in the same range as Hanks's 2013 hostage drama Captain Phillips, which opened with $25.7 million, and the 2012 airline drama Flight at $24.9 million. The weekend after Labor Day has historically been a lackluster period for film revenues, although Deadline Hollywood noted that this doesn't apply to the ""more intriguing titles"". Sully was one of four wide releases of that weekend. According to ticket selling website Fandango, it outsold Hanks's previous film, Bridge of Spies in advance ticket sales. It earned $1.35 million from Thursday previews at 2,700 theaters, which marked the biggest of Hanks's career, and was considered strong by Box Office Mojo given that it coincided with the first NFL game of the season. On its opening day it made $12.2 million (including Thursday previews), of which $1.3 million came from IMAX. It is the second-biggest Friday ever for a wide Eastwood opening, trailing behind only the $30 million opening day of American Sniper. In total, it grossed $35 million from its opening weekend, which is one of the top five September openings of all time (or twelfth adjusted for inflation). The debut is the second-biggest wide release opening for an Eastwood movie, behind the $89 million of American Sniper, and Hanks's third-biggest live-action debut behind The Da Vinci Code ($77 million in 2006) and Angels & Demons ($46 million in 2009). It also performed exceptionally well in IMAX, having been shot entirely in that format: for the weekend alone, it brought in a record $4 million from 375 auditoriums, being 11% of the total gross. This broke the previous September weekend record held by The Equalizer of $3.1 million in 2014.The film continued to dominate the box office, with only a modest decline of 36% to post $21.6 million in its second weekend, despite competition from three new wide releases: Blair Witch, Bridget Jones's Baby and Snowden. It finally lost the top spot in its third weekend, after the releases of The Magnificent Seven and Storks.Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow were thrilled by these results, as were theater owners, particularly as September tends to see a fall in box offices as schools re-open and new TV shows are marketed. Scott Mendelson of Forbes magazine suggested that the film had potential to surpass $100 million, since Tom Hanks's films tend to be ""leggy"" and post big multiples, and Sully is aimed at older audiences who don't usually go to the opening weekend. Deadline Hollywood pointed out that the marketing effort had been key to the robust opening (as well as good reviews and positive word of mouth), despite the absence of both Eastwood and Hanks on social media. The film was released on the 15th anniversary of the infamous September 11 attacks, but Warner Bros.' domestic distribution chief Jeff Goldstein said that the anniversary did not post a big – either negative or positive – impact on the film. According to a comScore audience survey, 82% of the moviegoers were older than 25, 80% above 35, and women comprised 56% of the opening weekend. 39% said Hanks was their principal reason for seeing it.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.Peter Debruge of Variety gave a positive review, praising Hanks and saying, ""This is Hanks' show, and he delivers a typically strong performance, quickly allowing us to forget that we're watching an actor. With his snowy white hair and moustache to match, Hanks conveys a man confident in his abilities, yet humble in his actions, which could also be said of Eastwood as a director."" IGN reviewer Simon Thompson awarded 9/10, writing: ""Sully is a beautifully balanced, classily nuanced and hugely engaging film that avoids all the clichéd pitfalls it could have slipped into. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career and Clint Eastwood's direction is beautiful and rich. It's not just a great movie, Sully is one of the best pieces of cinema that a major Hollywood studio has released this year."" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised both the film and Eastwood's direction, saying it is ""economical and solid, and generally low-key when it's not freaking you out"".Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it ""[A] vigorous and involving salute to professionalism and being good at your job"". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave 3.5 out of 4 stars and wrote, ""the movie earns your attention and respect by digging deep, by finding the fear and self-doubt inside a man who'd never accept being defined as a hero. It's an eye-opener."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded it 4 out of 4 stars, praising the film as ""an absolute triumph"" and saying that Hanks ""delivers another in a long line of memorable, nomination-worthy performances.""In a negative review, John Anderson of Time wrote, ""Inevitable is how Sully feels. That, and a little soggy, given that the storyline is rooted not in the few seconds of Sullenberger's defining act of heroism, but in the way his conscience, and the National Transportation Safety Board, plagued him in its aftermath.""

Section: Dispute of depiction of NTSB (2):
The film generated controversy for its depiction of the National Transportation Safety Board as antagonistic. In a promotional video preceding the release, Eastwood claimed that the NTSB had ""railroaded"" Sullenberger by ""trying to paint the picture that he had done the wrong thing."" After its release, NTSB investigators objected to their portrayal. Christine Negroni wrote in The New York Times that ""the film's version of the inquiry veers from the official record in both tone and substance"", depicting the investigators as ""departing from standard protocol in airline accident inquiries"" and instead fictionalizing  them as ""prosecutorial and closed-minded"". NTSB lead investigator Robert Benzon further disputed the film's depiction, saying that investigators ""weren't out to embarrass anybody at all"", while a former NTSB investigator expressed concern that moviegoers would take it as evidence of ""government incompetence"".
While the film has the NTSB presenting flight simulations showing that the airplane could have been landed at an airport, in the actual public hearing, Investigator-in-Charge Robert Benzon stated that ""These flight simulations revealed that a successful return to LaGuardia or a diversion to Teterboro Airport was not assured"". After the film was released Benzon said: I do not know why the writer and director chose to twist the role of the NTSB into such an inaccurate depiction. Their treatment of the NTSB went very far beyond cinematic license into simple mean-spirited dishonesty. The movie may actually be detrimental to aviation safety. Pilots involved in accidents will now expect harsh, unfair treatment by investigators.
Hanks told the Associated Press that Sullenberger himself was disturbed by the fictionalized version, going so far as to ask (having reviewed an early draft of the script) that the NTSB investigators' real names be removed from the characters. According to Hanks, Sullenberger felt that the real-life investigators ""were not prosecutors"" and it was not fair to associate them with changes in the story to depict ""more of a prosecutorial process"".

John Bennett has been divorced from Lori for six months. Meanwhile, his best friend Ted the teddy bear marries his girlfriend, Tami-Lynn. Following a heated argument after being married a year, they decide to have a child. As Ted doesn't have sperm, John agrees to help find a donor. They ask Sam J. Jones but he declines due to a sperm count of one. Then they unsuccessfully try to break into Tom Brady's house and steal his sperm. Ultimately, John offers to donate his sperm.
Despite Ted and John's efforts, Tami-Lynn's historical drug use has rendered her infertile (despite having been clean for an extended period of time) and they decide to adopt. The background checks put Ted's legal status as a person into question. The state authorities of Massachusetts declare Ted property rather than a person, resulting in the loss of his job, his credit card and bank accounts are frozen and his marriage to Tami-Lynn is forcibly annulled.
John suggests that they take the state to court. They ask the best lawyer they can find, but he offers to assign their case pro bono to his niece Samantha, a novice lawyer. They are initially reluctant, but bond over their love of marijuana as they prepare to present the case.
Meanwhile, Donny, Ted's life-long stalker, is a janitor at the headquarters of toy company Hasbro, in New York City. He convinces the company CEO to hire an expert attorney to ensure that Ted maintains his status as property, leaving him open to seizure by the firm to create more living teddy bears.
Despite Samantha's best efforts, the court rules against Ted. Disheartened and desperate, the trio contact Patrick Meighan, a highly respected civil rights attorney, to help overturn the court's decision. Driving to Manhattan, the trio meet Meighan, who is sympathetic to Ted's plight but refuses the case, as he believes Ted has not significantly contributed to humanity due to his lifestyle.
Ted, angry at the injustice and jealous of Samantha and John's relationship, stomps off. Donny follows him as he wanders into the New York Comic-Con. Once inside, Donny, disguised as Raphael attempts to kidnap Ted, who flees and contacts John for help. John and Samantha arrive and find Ted, just as Donny is about to cut him open. As they make their escape, Donny severs the cables holding up a model of the USS Enterprise with a knife and it swings towards Ted. John pushes Ted out of the way, takes the hit, gets knocked unconscious, and falls into a coma. Ted identifies Donny from a group of Ninja Turtle cosplayers through his need to dance to I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany Darwish and he is arrested.
At the hospital, John is still in a coma, and he flatlines. The next day, the doctor informs Sam, Ted and Tami-Lynn that John had passed away, shocking the group. In the room, the group is tearfully saying goodbye to John. However, he wakes up and scares the group, and Ted finds out that John had faked being dead as payback for Ted pretending to be brain dead. After some talking, the group rejoices when John recovers. Patrick Meighan decides to take the case, inspired by John's selflessness and Ted's emotions over John, his friend who barely avoided death. Meighan gets the ruling overturned by demonstrating that Ted is self-aware, that he feels complex emotions, and is capable of empathy. Outside the courthouse, Ted re-proposes to Tami-Lynn. After they are remarried, Ted and Tami-Lynn, adopting the surname of ""Clubber Lang"", adopt a baby boy, who they name Apollo Creed, while John and Samantha happily pursue their own relationship.
In a post-credits scene, a customer (Liam Neeson) who had previously purchased a box of Trix wanders back into the supermarket, visibly injured. He leaves the Trix behind and exits with a look of betrayal.

During the 2012 American Dad! Comic-Con panel, MacFarlane stated that he would be open to a sequel to Ted. In September 2012, chief executive Steve Burke said that the studio would be looking to make a sequel to Ted ""as soon as possible"". In January 2013, on Anderson Live, Wahlberg confirmed that a sequel was in the works and that it would be the first sequel in his career, while also revealing that he and Ted (as voiced by MacFarlane) would appear at the 85th Academy Awards. On October 2, 2013, it was announced Ted 2 would be released on June 26, 2015.Initially the storyline for the film was quite different and involved John and Ted's attempt to smuggle pot across the country, but, due to concerns that the concept was too similar to then recently released We're the Millers, the concept was scrapped and the storyline was overhauled to one inspired by John Jakes' North and South series as well as the life of Dred Scott.
During the period when the film was about drug smuggling, Mila Kunis' character was still in the sequel; however, when the storyline was changed, it required a lawyer to be the female lead and there wasn't room for Kunis's character.On February 14, 2014, Amanda Seyfried was cast as the female lead.

While at the premiere of Batman Again, the Titans' team leader, Robin, is derided by the audience after a misunderstanding leads him to believe they are making a film about him. At the rest of the team's suggestion, Robin resolves that in order to get a film made about him and the Titans, they need an arch-nemesis. Nearby, Slade breaks into S.T.A.R. Labs to steal a crystal. The Titans arrive and attempt to stop him, but he swiftly defeats and insults them.
The next day, Starfire, Cyborg, Raven and Beast Boy create a film to cheer up Robin, but he turns it off prematurely believing they are making fun of him. He declares that they will go to Hollywood to have a film made about them (""Upbeat Inspirational Song About Life""). Upon arriving at Warner Bros. Studios, they encounter director Jade Wilson, who is responsible for all the Superhero films being made. She turns down the Titans' request to be in a film (""My Superhero Movie""), explaining that the only way she would make one about them is if they were the only superheroes in the world. The Titans take her words literally, and go back in time to prevent the origins of the other superheroes (""Crystals"" and ""Back in Time""), but this only ends up ruining the present, forcing the Titans to go back in time again and undo their blunder.
Slade next arrives at Wayne Tech to infuse the crystal's power and the Titans arrive to stop him, this time putting up an actual fight. They secure the crystal, but Slade escapes, resolving to split Robin from his teammates.
The next day, Jade invites the Titans back to Hollywood and announces that she will make a movie about them due to their fight with Slade. While Robin is given a tour of the premises, Starfire, Raven, Cyborg and Beast Boy venture out and cause mischief (""Shenanigans""). They find a device labeled ""DOOMSDAY"" and try to destroy it, believing it to be a dangerous weapon. But Jade arrives and explains that D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y. is an acronym for a new streaming service for the new movie she is making. She resolves to drop the rest of the Titans from the film and make it solely about Robin, who after a brief pause, accepts, much to the dismay of his team. Robin sadly tells them that they are holding each other back and believes they should go their separate ways.
Robin makes his movie, but soon begins to regret his decision and misses his friends. As he makes the final scene of his movie, he interacts with a prop version of the Titan Tower door panel, a light falls and knocks him out. He awakens and finishes the scene where Jade reveals that they are now in the tower for real, and that she is actually Slade himself in disguise. He steals the crystal back and traps Robin, telling him that having made numerous superhero movies was part of his plot to keep all the heroes busy while he invaded their cities to build D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y., a device that can control minds and allow him to conquer the world. He then destroys the entire Titans Tower, but Robin safely manages to escape the exploding building. In the aftermath of the wreckage, Robin calls his friends and apologizes to them, who happily make peace with him.
At the premiere of Robin: The Movie, the Titans arrive and unmask Slade, but Slade unleashes the crystal's power to control the other heroes and sends them after the Titans. Robin goes after Slade while the rest of the team leads off the heroes. However, Slade manages to use his new power to control Robin, and tells him to attack his friends. When he has them cornered, they show him the rest of the movie they made for him, revealing that they believe he is a real hero and their friend who united them from the beginning. This causes Robin to come to his senses. Slade attempts to fight them with a giant robot, but the team uses a song (""GO! (Battle Remix)"") to take out Slade, though it is unknown what happened to him after he laughs at his defeat, altogether while also destroying the crystal, snapping the other heroes out of their trance. They all congratulate the Titans for their heroic efforts with Robin admitting that he has learned to be himself without needing a movie, When he tries to go on, everyone demands that they cut to the credits immediately with Robin attempting to stall so that ""kids can ask their parents questions."" Starfire breaks the fourth wall to say to go right to the credits, but Robin stops just before the film ends telling kids to ""ask their parents where babies come from.""
In a mid-credits scene, the Teen Titans from the 2003–2006 series appear on a distorted screen telling the audience that they ""found a way back"". In a post-credits scene, the Challengers of the Unknown, who were trapped in a portal by Raven at the Batman Again premiere earlier in the film, are still trapped, with Professor Haley postulating that they missed the movie.

Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com rated the film 3/4 stars, saying ""It's not a film designed to break ground or even offer too much social commentary on the role of superheroes in modern culture. It's built with the primary goal of making you laugh and forget your problems for just under 90 minutes, and it does exactly that.""GameSpot's Chris Hayner, while finding fault with what he deemed excessive toilet humor and some dragging in the film, said that ""In a superhero movie landscape where the world is constantly being destroyed by massive CGI abominations, this is a refreshing change... it doesn't forget how funny and exciting these types of movies can be.""

The film stars Steve Carell (who co-wrote the film's screenplay with Apatow) as the titular 40-year-old virgin Andy, a clerk at an electronic goods store, with Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, and Paul Rudd playing colleagues who resolve to help him lose his virginity. Catherine Keener also stars as Andy's love interest. Its screenplay features lots of improvised dialogue. Filming took place from January to April of 2005. The 40-Year-Old Virgin was released theatrically in North America on August 19, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $177 million worldwide.","Section: Plot (1):
40-year-old Andy Stitzer is an employee of electronics store Smart Tech and lives alone in his apartment with his collection of action figures and video games. When a conversation at a poker game with his co-workers David, Cal, and Jay turns to past sexual exploits, they learn that Andy is still a virgin and resolve to help him lose his virginity.
Andy's co-workers give Andy various, often contradictory pieces of advice on his appearance and how to interact with women. Jay drags Andy to various social events, books a painful waxing appointment, and sets him up with a transvestite prostitute, but all end with embarrassing results. Cal advises Andy to simply be confident and ""ask questions,"" which he practices on a bookstore clerk named Beth, who quickly becomes intrigued by him. David gives Andy his porn collection, encouraging him to masturbate.
Andy eventually lands a date with Trish Piedmont, a woman he meets on the sales floor. At the end of Andy and Trish's first date, they almost have sex but are interrupted by Trish's teenage daughter Marla. Trish suggests that they postpone having sex, and Andy enthusiastically agrees; they agree to abstain for twenty dates. Andy and Trish's relationship flourishes over the following weeks. Trish encourages Andy's dream of starting a business, suggesting they fund it by selling his collectibles. After Marla argues with Trish over wanting birth control, Andy takes her to a group information session at a sexual health clinic, where she is demeaned as a virgin. Andy admits his own virginity to defend her, earning him Marla's respect.
Meanwhile, David suffers an emotional breakdown at work over his obsession with his ex-girlfriend, Amy, and takes a vow of celibacy. Concerned for David, Cal hires a woman named Bernadette to work at the store hoping to match her with him. Jay's girlfriend breaks up with him due to his infidelity, and after getting in a fight with a customer, Jay concedes to Andy that sex can ruin a relationship. Jay and his girlfriend eventually reconcile, and he invites Andy and the others to a nightclub to celebrate his girlfriend's pregnancy.
On Trish and Andy's twentieth date, Trish tries to initiate sex, but Andy resists, which upsets her. The two argue, and Andy leaves to meet his friends at a nightclub. He gets drunk and leaves with Beth to have sex at her apartment. Cal gets David and Bernadette to hook up, while Marla convinces Trish to make up with Andy. At Beth's, Andy sobers up and decides to leave without having sex just as his friends arrive and encourage him to go back to Trish.
Andy returns to his apartment to find Trish waiting for him. She has found David's porn collection; Andy tries to explain, but she flees in alarm and disgust, fearing Andy may be a sexual deviant. While pursuing Trish on his bike, Andy collides with her car and flies through the side of a billboard truck. Trish rushes to his side, and Andy finally confesses that he is a virgin. Trish is relieved and accepting, and the couple profess their love for each another.
Andy and Trish eventually marry in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, with a sidelong mention that Andy's action figures sold for over half a million dollars. The couple then consummates the marriage. The film ends with a musical sequence where all the characters sing and dance to ""Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In"".

The film is based on a sketch Carell created while performing with the improv comedy troupe Second City. Carell did many versions of the sketch, trying out different scenarios where the 40-year-old man is hiding a ""big secret.""
Apatow had difficulty coming up with the ending for the film. Garry Shandling suggested it was important to show that Andy was having better sex because he was in love, and instead of directly showing the sex they decided to have Andy sing and have a musical number.
Apatow started casting the film early in the development process and having no preconceptions about the friends and workers in the store was able to tailor the script to the strengths of the actors. Catherine Keener was the first choice for the female lead.Filming for The 40-Year-Old Virgin started on January 17, 2005, and wrapped on April 1, 2005. Production on the film was halted by Universal Pictures after the first week, due to concerns that the physical appearance of Carell's character resembled that of a serial killer, and that the early footage was not funny. Paul Rudd was criticized for being overweight and the studio was unhappy with how Apatow was ""lighting [the film] like an indie"". Universal had also refused to allow Apatow to cast Jason Segel in the film.The chest waxing scene was done for real, with five cameras set up to capture the moment.
The production used over a million feet of film, a milestone reached on the last day of filming and recognized with free champagne by Technicolor. Using the conversion of 90 feet of film per minute, this means that the shooting ratio for the film is 96:1 (96 feet shot for each foot used in the release after editing) for the theatrical version (84:1 for the unrated version).The American Humane Association withheld its ""no animals were harmed..."" disclaimer due to the accidental deaths of several tropical fish used in the film.

Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post is critical of the film but praised Carell for his performance: ""the most surprising thing about 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' may be that despite the flagrantly exploitative and gratuitous efforts of his friends, Andy remains steadfastly chaste and genuinely humane. [...] Carell has succeeded in creating a character of old-fashioned decency in a movie that otherwise flouts it at every turn.""The film was criticized by Harry Forbes of Catholic News Service for promoting ""the false premise that there's something intrinsically wrong with an unmarried man being sexually inexperienced,"" and by political columnist Cal Thomas for being an example of societal decline in regards to ""self-control or what was once known as purity.""

K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Lithgow. The storyline follows Christian Wolff, a certified public accountant with high-functioning autism who makes his living uncooking the books of criminal  and terrorist organizations around the world that are experiencing internal embezzlement.
The Accountant premiered in Los Angeles on October 10, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on October 14, 2016. Receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $155 million worldwide. It received praise for the action sequences featuring Pencak silat, an Indonesian martial art.","Section: Plot (1):
As a child, Christian Wolff is diagnosed with high-functioning autism at Harbor Neuroscience. Chris's father declines the offer for his son to stay in an environment better for his sensory processing disorder, believing that Chris must overcome the hardships of his condition, but Chris's overwhelmed mother abandons their family. Afraid that others will exploit his son, Chris's father—a US Army PSYOP officer—begins a brutal regimen of stoicism and martial arts training for him and his brother, Braxton.
In the present, Chris works as a forensic accountant from a small strip mall office in Plainfield, Illinois. He unmasks insider financial deceptions, often for criminal and terrorist enterprises. Chris's clients interact with Chris through the Voice, an unidentified woman who calls him ""Dreamboat"". He exposes himself daily to loud music and flashing lights to inure himself to sensory overload.
Director of FinCEN Ray King pursues Chris, known as ""the Accountant"". King blackmails Treasury data analyst Marybeth Medina to help him locate the Accountant. Her leads include Chris's cover names, a recording from his killing of nine members of the Gambino crime family, and some photos.
Chris is hired to audit Living Robotics after the company's founder and CEO, Lamar Blackburn, and his sister Rita learn of discrepancies from in-house accountant Dana Cummings. Chris finds that over $61 million has been embezzled from the company. CFO Ed Chilton, who is diabetic, is forced by a hitman to commit suicide from an insulin overdose. Lamar dismisses Chris, claiming Chilton killed himself because of the embezzlement, leaving Chris very distraught because he cannot finish the audit.
Medina isolates Chris's voice from the recording of the Gambino killing, hearing him repeating the nursery rhyme ""Solomon Grundy"". She learns that his vocal cadence is reminiscent of those with autism, and that Chris's aliases are famed mathematicians, including his current identity, Christian Wolff. Using IRS records, she finds his Illinois office.
Assassins fail to kill Chris; the last reveals that Dana is the next target. Chris saves her before taking her to his storage unit, containing an Airstream Panamerica with artwork and other valuables, which he uses to quickly flee in when necessary. As they talk, he realizes that the embezzlement at Living Robotics is a scheme like Crazy Eddie's; money stolen from the company is returned to it, boosting profits and increasing the company's valuation as it prepares for an initial public offering. When Chris goes to confront Rita he finds her dead, exposing Lamar as the embezzler.
Government agents search Chris's heavily secured home. King explains to Medina that Chris was imprisoned at Leavenworth because of a fight at his estranged mother's funeral, where his father was killed protecting Chris. He learned accounting from Francis Silverberg, a Gambino family accountant who became an FBI informant. King was Silverberg's handler, but his inaction led to Silverberg being brutally killed; King was staking out the Gambinos when Chris came to avenge his mentor. Chris could have killed King, but let him go after asking if he was a good father. King began getting information from the Voice when criminals violated Chris's moral code, and became director of FinCen. King tells Medina someone has to take over when he retires. The phone rings, and the Voice tells Medina about Living Robotics.
Chris goes to Lamar's mansion, where the hitman and his men await. During the battle, the hitman recognizes Chris repeating the nursery rhyme and reveals that he is Chris's brother Braxton; they have not seen each other since Chris's imprisonment. Braxton attacks Chris, blaming him for their father's death. During a pause in their fight Lamar interrupts; Chris shoots him, ending the battle. Chris amicably agrees to meet Braxton in a week, saying he will find him.
As another set of parents visits Harbor Neuroscience with their child, the boy meets Justine, the daughter of the clinic's director, who is a patient there; she is revealed to be the Voice, and Chris funds the center with his bookkeeping profits. Dana receives a Jackson Pollock painting she saw in the trailer, as Chris drives out of town with the Airstream in tow.

Cribbing more than a few notes from the Taken handbook, The Beast unleashes a mentally unstable special forces veteran with a particular set of skills on the ruthless gang of undesirables who kidnapped his young daughter. What Movies Will It Remind You Of? The Taken vibes are strong here. Riva, the broken ex-soldier, finds his way toward redemption the only way he can, which is through brutally whaling on henchmen until he gets back his young daughter, who is seemingly the only person left on earth who can still love him. In its portrayal of contemporary Italy as a neon-streaked, hollowed out urban playground for lowlifes, murderous criminals, and child abductors, there are shades of Suburra (Netflix), as well as the gripping 2008 film Gomorrah, about criminal gangs at war in Naples.

Performance Worth Watching: In a film with so much darkness in its heart, the role of the morally vacant crime boss who lives by his own absurd code of ethics is key. Andrea Pennacchi (Suburra) understands this, and he’s perfect in The Beast as Mozart, weaving simultaneous threads of mustachioed flamboyance and casual sociopathy.

Memorable Dialogue: Simonetti, the chief inspector, understands who The Beast is, knows what he’s capable of. “Riva is not coming back,” he tells a colleague. “He knows he has lost any chance of friendly dialogue with us.” The cops not only have to find Riva’s daughter; they have to try and contain an uncaged animal.

Sex and Skin: Riva kicks the crap out of a cross-dressing prostitute in his search for information, and he infiltrates a bordello that doubles as Mozart’s headquarters.

Our Take: Like Liam Neeson in Taken, Italian actor Fabrizio Gifuni is a broad and forceful physical presence in The Beast. Glowering from under his eyebrows at the conventional world around him, he plays Riva as a man outside of it. And when it’s time to bust heads, he’s more than willing to destroy it in his search for truth. He’s a machine, once dormant, now powered up and firing on all cylinders. The Beast becomes that, too, and only that, once Riva’s search for his little girl kicks into gear. As the inspector on the case, Lino Musella is a smart, steady presence, but there isn’t much for him to do besides drink coffee, stalk the police department ready room in frustration, and doggedly chase after Riva. (As Angela, Riva’s wife, Monica Piseddu has even less to do.) There’s a single dimension here, and it’s The Beast’s relentless hunt for his kidnapped daughter. The cops can only react to it, his wife and son are left to wait around on the sidelines, and even his PTSD, while its severity is represented with violent flashbacks to Riva’s experiences in war, is only a mechanism to make the machine go. Watch out, bad guys. The Beast is on the loose.

Our Call: SKIP IT. While it goes all in on the skull cracking and henchmen fights, The Beast doesn’t surround its single minded protagonist with enough dramatic cellulose to offset or even validate his lawless persistence.",5.2,3527,"Action, Crime, Drama ",Negative,0.575

Later that night, Tom's son Harry laments the end of summer while drinking at a bar with friends, including conspiracy theorist Dale. While giving Dale a ride home that night, Harry crashes into and maims a bird that soon dies.
Other reports of strange phenomena soon become evident on the island, including tons of dead fish washing ashore. Meanwhile, Harry notices strange behavior from his father such as taking his fishing boat out during the middle of the night and becoming unresponsive during conversation. Despite some misgivings, Harry's sister Audry who lives on the Rhode Island mainland is sent from her job at the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the strange wildlife occurrences along with her coworker Paul. Audry takes her daughter Emily along and decides to stay on the island with her father and brother despite some lingering tension after the death of her mother.
As Audry and Paul investigate the strange occurrences, Harry attempts to bond with his niece by showing Emily how to fish and catch frogs. Tom's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, and one night the house is awoken by Emily's screams on the couch while Tom hovers over her. They chalk this up to night terrors, but Audry's concerns for her father are later realized when Tom again takes his boat out during the middle of the night and vanishes without a trace. The local police assuade Audry and Harry to accept that their father has likely drowned, which is soon proven true as Tom's body washes ashore.
Harry struggles to accept the circumstances of his father's death, including several bruises and lacerations on his face and additional signs of disarray and a malfunctioning radio aboard the fishing vessel after Tom disappeared. Harry's mental health deteriorates as his other estranged sister Jen returns home to Block Island from New York for the funeral, during which Harry gets in a fight with an older man resulting in a night spent in jail. After being released, he talks more with Dale and learns that similar disturbances have been happening across the world. He also decides to borrow scuba equipment to investigate the area where Tom drowned, but becomes unconscious underwater only to awaken on the fishing vessel while the electronics are scrambled and a strange noise is emitted.
Harry hits a deer while being haunted by a vision of his father after dropping Jen off at the ferry, and his increasingly erratic behavior spurs Audry to bring him to a psychologist in Providence to help diagnose Harry's condition. The psychologist speculates that his mental health may be suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity caused by the Block Island Wind Farm and encourages Harry and Audry to contact a former patient with similar experiences that has cut off all contact from electronics. Harry escalates on a path of insanity, stealing a neighbor's dog aboard his boat and steering toward the same spot in the Block Island Sound until a bizarre experience occurs where everything on the boat including Harry and the Dog begin to ascend towards the sky. Harry crashes down to the boat but the dog goes missing, leaving behind only its leash.
Enraged by this most recent episode and news of the missing dog, Audry entrusts Paul to watch Emily and look after Harry while she drives to meet the former patient who lives alone in a camper in West Greenwich. The man startles Audry and professes that his paranoia is a result of being watched or influenced by some other-worldly force. While Audry is unsettled by the encounter and drives back to take the last ferry home, Harry resists yet another vision of his father to take the ""girl"" (Emily) and takes a night-time drive where he narrowly avoids crashing into a female jogger. He then attempts to attack the woman but fails, and returns back to the house where Paul still watches Emily. 
Audry returns to find that Paul has been knocked unconscious and hears Emily's screams as Harry abducts her onto the fishing boat. Audry manages to jump onto the vessel right as it leaves the dock, but is unable to reason with her psychotic brother who again returns to the site of the disturbance. Audry manages to barricade Emily and herself within the cabin of the boat, and they soon experience a wailing sound and rattling as objects on the boat start ascending into the sky yet again. Audry and Emily are then sent flying to the ceiling, and Audry is forced into the sky as the cabin door gives way. The next morning, Emily is discovered alone in the cabin of the vessel by the local authorities.
The movie ends with Audry being dropped into the ocean as a voice-over plays from an earlier scene where she describes to Emily why biologists justify taking certain individual fish out of their natural habitat in order to study them.

109,The Champion,Italy,Groenlandia,01 Distribution,,"Leonardo D'Agostini, Antonella Lattanzi",105,Leonardo D'Agostini,,1180367,"Il campione è un film del 2019 diretto da Leonardo D'Agostini, al suo esordio alla regia di un lungometraggio, che vede protagonisti Stefano Accorsi e Andrea Carpenzano.
",,,,"Since his director-producer friend Matteo Rovere first invited him to star in The Champion [+], Stefano Accorsi has undergone some kind of cinematographic catharsis, evolving from a drug-addicted, once-brilliant rally driver in Italian Race [+] into a calm and quiet, velvet-jacket-wearing history teacher. The transformation is such that in one scene of the film, when he casually finds himself behind the wheel of one of the Lamborghinis belonging to the rich and temperamental football champion in question (Andrea Carpenzano), he presses his foot to the accelerator in a sublime moment of ecstasy, a world away from his usual Fiat Multipla experience. 
(The article continues below - Commercial information)

Although newcomer Leonardo D'Agostini’s directorial style is lacking in any real drive, The Champion nevertheless hits the mark. It’s a canny production which delivers a moral lesson, mixing the two perfectly and blending the spectacular with the intimate. But above all, it makes full use of the extraordinary talent of lead actor, Andrea Carpenzano (who already made a name for himself last year, with his intense performance in Boys Cry [+] by the D’Innocenzo brothers), who is “used” expertly by his accomplished colleague, Accorsi. 

Carpenzano is Christian Ferro, a very young striker for Roma with the talent of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was born into an outlying area of the city once considered to be as run down as the Roman Trullo district. For this reason, he’s rebellious, without much time for rules (in the style of Balotelli). In the first sequences of the film, his friends put him to the test, accusing him of having “cleaned himself up”, and in order to show them he’s still the same as before despite his €3 million per annum income, the publicity which surrounds him and the sponsorship deals he enjoys, he runs away without paying for the expensive clothes he was trying on in a boutique. It’s the latest in a long line of stunts and the team chairman (Massimo Popolizio) is forced to find a solution to bring the player back in line. After a series of “auditions” with various tutors who would be tasked with preparing Christian for his final high-school exam, the chairman hires the learned and ever frowning teacher, Valerio Fioretti, who knows nothing about football nor the big business associated with that particular world, and who has never even heard of the young champion idolised by fans. In this respect, the emerging screenwriters (Giulia Steigerwalt and Antonella Lattanzi, alongside the director) have employed the classic technique of placing two diametrically opposed characters side by side. The teacher with all his money worries, having separated from his wife (Anita Caprioli) after a devastating row, tries to get through to his ultra-ignorant student who lives in a villa with Ferraris and Lamborghinis parked out front, and is surrounded by an entourage of friends/parasites permanently glued to videogames, a girlfriend with 500,000 followers on Instagram, a scrounging father and a frenetic agent (Mario Sgueglia). The teacher has no time for all this and as he observes the striker’s strategic thinking and ability to read the game, he finds a way of teaching him about World War I and about what really counts in life. Also on hand to bring the boy back down to earth is Alessia (the promising Ludovica Martino), who is similarly immune to the fame and riches of the footballer. She too grew up in the outskirts of the city alongside Christian and is paying her way through school by re-stocking vending machines at the Roma team’s training ground. 

Produced by Matteo Rovere and Sydney Sibilia with Groenlandia and RAI Cinema, in association with 3 Marys Entertainment, the film was granted permission by AS Roma to use the Club’s logo and kits, and to film inside the actual Trigoria Sports Centre, which lent a touch of authenticity to the story and the match scenes.

The Christmas Chronicles received mixed reviews from critics. A sequel, titled The Christmas Chronicles 2, was released on November 25, 2020, with much of the original cast returning.","Section: Plot (1):
In Lowell, Massachusetts, near Christmas, widowed mother Claire (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) struggles to hold her family together after the death of her firefighter husband Doug (Oliver Hudson). Her son Teddy (Judah Lewis) has lost his Christmas spirit and has become a troublemaker, and engages in malicious activities such as stealing cars. Her younger daughter Kate (Darby Camp) nevertheless is trying to keep Christmas spirit alive while keeping a strong belief in Santa Claus. Kate catches Teddy stealing a car from a parking lot and films it, threatening to show the tape to Claire, but changes her mind and tells Claire that Teddy had broken a picture frame instead. 
On Christmas Eve, Claire is forced to fill in for a coworker, leaving Teddy to look after Kate. While watching old Christmas videos, Kate notices a strange arm appear out of the fireplace. Kate believes this is Santa and convinces Teddy to help her by promising to destroy the tape of Teddy committing the felony. The two set up a makeshift trip wire and a hidden camera. Kate is later woken up and sees Santa in the living room. However, he escapes to the roof, and the two children follow. Kate decides to hide in his sleigh to get a closer look, and Teddy reluctantly follows her. Santa rides off with the kids in tow. When Kate decides to make her presence known, Santa and the reindeer are startled and he loses control of the sleigh. After teleporting to Chicago, Illinois, the sleigh breaks down, causing the reindeer to scatter and Santa's hat and bag of presents to be lost.
Santa (Kurt Russell) introduces himself to the kids, and tells them that he has to get back to delivering presents as soon as possible or else the Christmas Spirit will be gone. Without his hat, Santa cannot move quickly or through tight spaces like he normally does. The kids are forced to help him after he threatens to put them on the naughty list permanently. They stop at a bar where Santa tries to seek help from the patrons. When they get no assistance, they steal a car, which itself was already stolen by the bartender.They locate the reindeer but encounter a police car driven by police officers Dave Poveda (Martin Roach) and Mikey Jameson (Lamorne Morris). Kate goes after the reindeer by herself while Teddy and Santa lure the police away. Santa is arrested, while Kate and Teddy escape with the reindeer. The kids find Santa's bag, and Kate goes inside to find help. She is teleported to the North Pole where she encounters Santa's elves, who agree to help her.
Meanwhile, Teddy is attacked by a group of thugs who take him and the bag to their hideout, where he is saved by Kate and the elves, who then set out to repair Santa's sleigh. At the police precinct, Santa tries to explain his situation to Officer Poveda. When Santa reveals his wish this year is to reconcile with his ex-wife Lisa, who also shares that wish, Poveda is taken aback, but still refuses to believe him. Poveda has Santa locked in the holding cell, though he becomes suspicious when he sees a larger number of arrests than usual on Christmas Eve. Seeing that Christmas Spirit has gotten too low, Santa gathers all the inmates to perform ""Santa Claus Is Back in Town"", which works amongst all the officers except Poveda. Poveda is finally convinced when he receives a call from Lisa, who invites him out for coffee in the morning, and agrees to let Santa go. One of the elves arrives through the air vent to give Santa a spare hat. Santa goes outside to find his sleigh repaired.
Santa sees that he only has an hour until morning to complete delivering presents, so the kids agree to help him. Santa is able to deliver all the presents, saving Christmas. Afterwards, he drops the kids off back at their home before their mother returns. Santa gives Teddy his hat as a memento, showing that he did not really need it. When he leaves, he gives Kate a ""Ho, Ho, Ho"", a saying he previously stated was an urban myth about him.
When Claire returns, they go inside to find that the living room has been decorated like their father used to do it. When the kids open their gifts from Santa on Christmas morning, Kate gets the skateboard she asked for, while Teddy gets a magic ornament. When Teddy hangs it on the tree, he sees his dad magically appear in his reflection, and they both express pride in each other.
Back in the North Pole, Santa reunites with Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) who has come home.

The film had a limited theatrical release prior to beginning to stream on Netflix on November 25, 2020.","Section: Plot (1):
Two years have passed since the events of the last film. Kate Pierce is now a cynical 13 year old who is unhappy spending a family Christmas in Cancún, Mexico with her mom Claire, her brother Teddy, her mom's new boyfriend Bob, and his son Jack (Jahzir Bruno). She wants to be back home where it's snowing and more like a real Christmas. Kate decides to run away and get an early flight back home to Boston. She catches a shuttle that Jack sneaks on to. They are unexpectedly transported to the North Pole by the driver Belsnickel, a nefarious Christmas elf.
Kate and Jack are discovered and saved by Santa Claus who brings them back to his house and Mrs. Claus. The Clauses give the kids a grand tour of their village and all it has to offer. The four of them go back to the house for dinner. Jack and Kate go to bed as Belsnickel and his follower Speck begin an attempt to destroy the village.  Mrs. Claus tells the kids the origin story of Santa in Turkey and how he saved the elves from extinction, and received the Star of Bethlehem, a magical artifact that stops time in and provides power to Santa's Village. The Claus' adopted Belsnickel. As he grew up and they had less time for him, he became naughty, causing him to be transformed into a human as a curse, and ran away.
Belsnickel releases Jola, a yule cat, into the reindeer pen, injuring Dasher. Belsnickel releases a potion into the village that cause the elves to go insane. He steals the Star of Bethlehem on top of the village's Christmas tree. Santa and the others confront him. Santa attempts to take the star back and in the struggle between him and Belsnickel it is accidentally destroyed, causing the power to go out in the village. The maddened elves start a snowball fight that gives Belsnickel time to escape. Santa and Kate leave for Turkey in order to get the forest elves led by Hakan to build a new star. Jack leaves to get a root to cure the crazed elves while Mrs. Claus stays behind to tend to Dasher. Kate and Santa find the elves who build a casing for a new star and Santa captures the power of the Star of Bethlehem inside it. 
While flying back to the village, Belsnickel catches up to them on a sleigh pulled by his jackalotes (a hybrid of a jackal and a coyote) which he created, steals the star so he can stop himself from aging long enough to figure out how to replace Santa, and transports them back to 1990 Boston via a time-travel device he planted on Santa's sleigh. Jack finds the root and brings it back to Mrs. Claus. Kate attempts to buy AAA batteries for Belsnickel's time travel device, which she and Santa now possess, at the Boston airport to transport her and Santa back to the future. However, she is detained by an airport security member due to apparent counterfeit (the money was marked 2020). Kate is taken to a locked security room with kids who have lost their parents. When Kate becomes upset about her wrongdoings at Cancun, another kid, Doug, comforts Kate and helps her escape the room. After Kate joins Santa, she realizes Doug Pierce is her late father. With help from a worker named Grace, Santa gets everybody singing a Christmas song as the weather clears up. With Christmas spirit high enough for the sleigh to fly, Santa puts the batteries in and they transport back and recover the star.
Mrs. Claus makes the root into a powder. Jack fights his way to the snow cannons, places the powder inside, and shoots it onto the elves, curing them. Santa and Kate race back to the village evading Belsnickel as he chases them. Mrs. Claus throws an explosive gingerbread cookie in between both sleighs before they can collide in a game of chicken. Dasher recovers and assists Santa in defeating Jola, the latter hurling the yule cat out of the village. Kate places the star on top of the tree, restoring power to the village. Santa gives Belsnickel the first toy they built together, and Belsnickel reconciles with them, transforming back into an elf. Santa flies Kate and Jack back to Cancún where they inform an excited Teddy about their adventure and Kate becomes more accepting of Bob.

It had a limited release on 15 January 2021, followed by streaming on Netflix on 29 January 2021. The film received positive reviews from critics and has received five nominations for the British Academy Film Awards, including for Outstanding British Film.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1939, Suffolk landowner Edith Pretty hires local self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown to tackle the large burial mounds at her rural estate in Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge. At first, she offers the same money he received from the Ipswich Museum, the agricultural wage, but he says it is inadequate; so she ups her offer by 12% to £2 a week (approximately £120 in 2020), which he accepts.
Former employers try unsuccessfully to persuade Brown to work on a Roman villa they deem more important. They ignore Brown, who left school aged 12, when he suggests the mounds could be Anglo-Saxon rather than the more common Viking era.
Working with assistants from Pretty’s estate, Brown slowly excavates the more promising of the mounds. One day the trench collapses on him, but they dig him out in time. Meanwhile, he spends more time with Edith, a widow, and her young son, Robert, and ignores daily letters from his wife, May. Edith struggles with her health, warned by her doctor to avoid stress.
Brown is astonished to uncover iron rivets from a ship, making it the burial site of someone of tremendous distinction, such as a king. Prominent local archaeologist James Reid Moir attempts to join the dig but is rebuffed; Edith instead hires her cousin Rory Lomax to join the project. News of the discovery soon spreads, and Cambridge archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives, declares the site to be of national importance, and takes over the dig by order of the Office of Works.
As war approaches, Philips brings in a large team, including Peggy Piggott, who uncovers proof that it is Anglo-Saxon in origin. Brown is demoted to only keep the site in order, but Edith intervenes and he resumes digging. Brown discovers a Merovingian Tremissis, a small gold coin of Late Antiquity, and Philips declares the site to be of major historical significance. Philips wants to send all the artefacts to the British Museum, but Edith, concerned about war raids in London, asserts her rights. An inquest confirms she is the owner of the ship and its priceless treasure trove of grave goods, but she despairs as her health continues to decline.
Peggy, neglected by her husband Stuart, begins a romance with Rory, but he is soon called up by the Royal Air Force. Edith decides to donate the Sutton Hoo treasure to the British Museum, requesting that Brown be given recognition for his work. She dies in 1942.
The treasure was hidden in the London Underground during the war and first exhibited — without any mention of Basil Brown — nine years after Edith's death. Only recently was Brown given full credit for his contribution and his name is now displayed permanently alongside Pretty's at the British Museum.

Pictures,Sean Astin Josh Brolin Jeff Cohen Corey Feldman Kerri Green Martha Plimpton Ke Huy Quan,Chris Columbus,114,Richard Donner,19000000,124000000,"The Goonies is a 1985 American adventure comedy film co-produced and directed by Richard Donner from a screenplay by Chris Columbus, based on a story by executive producer Steven Spielberg. In the film, a band of kids who live in the ""Goon Docks"" neighborhood of Astoria, Oregon, attempt to save their homes from foreclosure and, in doing so, they discover an old treasure map that takes them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willy, a legendary 17th-century pirate. During the adventure, they are chased by a family of criminals who want the treasure for themselves.
Produced by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, Warner Bros. released the film theatrically on June 7, 1985 in the United States. The film grossed $124 million worldwide on a budget of $19 million and has since become a cult film. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".","Section: Plot (1):
Facing foreclosure of their homes in the Goon Docks area of Astoria, Oregon, to an expanding country club, a group of children who call themselves ""the Goonies"" gather for a final weekend together. The Goonies include optimist lead Goonie Mikey Walsh, his older brother Brandon, the inventive Data, the talkative Mouth, and the overweight klutz Chunk.
Rummaging through the Walshes' attic, they come across a 1632 doubloon and an old treasure map purporting to lead to the treasure of legendary pirate “One-Eyed Willy” believed to be located somewhere nearby. Mikey considers “One-Eyed Willy” to be the original ""Goonie."" The kids evade Brandon and make their way to an abandoned restaurant on the coast that coincides with the map; Brandon soon follows alongside Andy, a cheerleader with a crush on him; and Stef, Andy's friend. The group quickly discovers the derelict restaurant is a hideout of the Fratelli crime family: Francis, Jake, and their mother Mama. The Goonies find a tunnel in the basement and follow it, but Chunk is captured by the Fratellis and imprisoned with their deformed and immensely strong younger brother Sloth. The Fratellis interrogate Chunk until he reveals where the Goonies have gone, and begin pursuit. Chunk is left behind with Sloth but befriends him. After Sloth frees both of them, Chunk calls the police and he and Sloth follow the Fratellis.
The Goonies evade several deadly booby traps along the tunnels while staying ahead of the Fratellis. Finally, they reach the grotto where Willy's pirate ship, the Inferno, is anchored. The group discovers the ship is filled with treasure and they start filling their pockets, but Mikey warns them not to take any on a set of scales in front of Willy, considering that to be their tribute to him. As they leave the ship, the Fratellis appear and strip them of their loot. They make the Goonies walk the plank until Chunk arrives with Sloth and distracts the Fratellis long enough for the Goonies to jump overboard. The Fratellis proceed to grab all the treasure they can, including those on Willy's scales; this triggers another booby trap that causes the grotto to cave in. With Sloth's help, the Goonies and Fratellis barely escape.
The two groups emerge on Astoria's beach, where they reunite with the Goonies' families and the police. The Fratellis are arrested, but Chunk prevents Sloth from also being taken; he invites Sloth to live with him, which he accepts. As the kids describe their adventure to their parents, the Walshes’ housekeeper, Rosalita discovers that Mikey's marble bag is filled with gems he took from the ship and had not been seized by the Fratellis. Mikey's father triumphantly rips up the foreclosure papers, declaring they have enough money to negate the foreclosure. As the Goonies celebrate, they see the Inferno, having broken free of the grotto, sailing off on its own in the distance.

Principal photography on The Goonies began on October 22, 1984, and lasted five months. There were an additional six weeks of audio dubbing recording. The shooting script was lengthy, at more than 120 pages, to which several sequences were eventually cut from the final theatrical version. During the film's dénouement, mention is made of an octopus which refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut.
In the documentary The Making of The Goonies, Richard Donner noted both the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. He praised them for their energy and excitement, but also said that they were also unruly when brought together. As a result, the documentary frequently showed him coaching the actors and revealing some techniques he used to create realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship, which was actually a full-sized replica of a pirate ship created under the direction of production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters; the characters' first glimpse of the ship was also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the final cut was actually the second take, due to the cast feeling so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be re-shot. It was later noted that the entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it.In his book There and Back Again, Sean Astin claimed that Donner and Steven Spielberg were ""like co-directors"" on the film as he compared and contrasted their styles when directing scenes.Some of the on-location filming was done in Astoria, Oregon. The interior and exterior of the old Clatsop County Jail features as the holding place of Jake Fratelli at the start of the film. (The building was later converted into the Oregon Film Museum, which opened on the 25th anniversary of The Goonies with memorabilia from this and other local films.) The museum where Mikey's father works is, in reality, the Captain George Flavel House Museum. The Walsh family home is a real home on the eastern end of the town. The road leading to the home was closed to tours in 2015. The scenes along the coast were filmed in Oregon, but they were a considerable distance from Astoria. The Goonies bicycle to Ecola State Park (in reality, over 26 miles south of Astoria) and then find the starting location of the map using Haystack Rock as a guide. Underground scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, including the cavernous set where the Goonies find One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was in Stage 16, one of the largest sound stages in the United States. The final scene was shot at Goat Rock State Beach in Sonoma County, California.The film also marked Wes Takahashi's first major motion picture as an animation supervisor for Industrial Light & Magic.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and called the film ""a smooth mixture of the usual ingredients from Steven Spielberg action movies, made special because of the high-energy performances of the kids who have the adventures."" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also awarded three stars out of four and wrote that after a dull start ""some kind of minor movie miracle takes place, and 'The Goonies' gets its act together as the kids stop trading wisecracks and get closer to finding their long-lost pirate treasure, thereby to help save their parents' homes. Only then do we accept 'The Goonies' for what it is—a funny juvenile windup toy about kids in perilous, comic book situations."" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film ""has a kind of breakneck pacing that keeps it fast, funny, ingenious, entertaining, and — only a small point while the movie is in progress — almost entirely without staying power."" Variety called it ""a dangerous Disneyland sort of a film stamped with the Steven Spielberg style of high fun. Like other Spielberg summer extravaganzas, pic is a roller coaster ride best enjoyed as it's speeding along. Once it stops to consider the sacred state of adolescence, it becomes painfully syrupy."" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film ""resembles nothing so much as a wildly exaggerated fun-fair ride, one that keeps comically exposing you to dangers, comically pulling you away, then, finally, with a shivering plop, deposits you on dry land, in the bosom of your family."" Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post called it ""an artfully crafted movie, thrumming with energy and sometimes wit, and utterly uninvolving for anyone over the age of 12.""Colin Greenland reviewed The Goonies for White Dwarf #73, and stated that ""The Goonies I was unable to enjoy because of a bunch of kids yelling and screaming all the way through. Not the audience, the actors.""Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 76% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 58 reviews and 91% of the audience giving it a positive review; the average rating is 6.32/10. The critical consensus: ""The Goonies is an energetic, sometimes noisy mix of Spielbergian sentiment and fun-house tricks that will appeal to kids and nostalgic adults alike."" At Metacritic it has a rating score of 62 based on 13 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".

",,"The Last Paradiso (L’ultimo paradiso) is a period melodrama co-written by and starring Riccardo Scamarcio, who has an Italian Clooney thing going on, and has starred in a handful of Netflix films in the last couple years. (You may recognize him from playing a supporting cretin in John Wick: Chapter 2.) The film is ostensibly a BOATS flick (yes: Based On A True Story) even though there’s no subtitle saying as much, but Scamarcio and co-writer/director Rocco Ricciardulli plucked bits from provincial lore and turned it into this mid-century romantic drama about a smalltown Lothario and his attempt to not only rebel against the cruel mafia-don jerk running things, but also skadoink the man’s muy bellisimo daughter. If that sounds like a bad idea, you may be on to something there. The Gist: Ciccio Paradiso (Scamarcio) is a married man with a young son who unashamedly dips his wick in many pots, if you know what I mean. His wife, Lucia (Valentina Cervi), knows what he’s up to. Hell, the whole town knows what he’s up to. Ciccio and Lucia stand in the church and he snacks on Communion wafers when she confronts him about his rampant infidelity, and he says he loves her, but loves many others, too: “For you, it’s a sin. For me, it’s not.” She kinda just shrugs. Maybe she needs to accept him for who he is? Maybe boys will just be boys? Maybe she’s more liberal than we thought? Who knows. But the women in this burg almost exclusively work in deference to the men, and those who’ve angered their husbands by getting a taste of Ciccio are likely drawn to him for his liberal, devil-may-care attitude.

Ciccio’s preferred babe-on-the-side is Bianca (Gaia Bermani Amaral). They have pork-happy picnics in the humble and lovely Italian countryside, nudge nudge wink. Her sister just tut-tuts and looks the other way. Bianca’s the lovely offspring of Cumpa Schettino (Antonio Gerardi), who employs all the locals in his wheat and olive fields. He’s a miser. He pays poorly. He has a taste for raping teenage girls out in the barn. But he gets away with everything, because we all know that HE WHO CONTROLS THE WHEAT AND OLIVES CONTROLS THE WORLD.

Ciccio is cocky, resilient. He takes it upon himself to rile the workers against Schettino, then stays out all night rolling in the hay with Bianca, quite literally, out in the barn, hopefully where the livestock don’t drop log too much. He’s a charismatic sort compared to the rest of the townsfolk, who seem content to toil endlessly and be dirt-poor and not indulge any animalian lust, for better or worse. Regardless, he sure seems to be crusin’ for a bruisin’ if he keeps riling up Schettino. Ciccio plans to R-U-N-N-O-F-T with Bianca, and maybe escape the oppressive conditions and meet up with his brother Antonio. And if you don’t expect this movie to make a bold narrative step right about now, well, you’d be wrong.What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: The Last Paradiso is kinda like Stealing Beauty or Under the Tuscan Sun but with more peasants and sonofabitchin’ olive lords.

Performance Worth Watching: Depth of character is a bit hard to come by here, but Lucia shows some unexpected complexity in her relative acceptance of Ciccio, thanks to Cervi not always adhering to boilerplate angry-wife-isms.

Memorable Dialogue: Ciccio gets poetic when describing Bianca: “She’s not just a woman. When she laughs at night, she makes the sun come out.” So does that make her a wizard or something?

Sex and Skin: Moonlit female toplessness set against a backdrop of prodigious hay, atop which Bianca and Ciccio partake in cornball-sensual lovemakery complete with romantic piano music and awkward thrust angles.

Our Take: So that bold narrative step I mentioned? It’s a big reveal that inspires a splutter of unintentional laughter and pushes The Last Paradiso deep into melodramatic soapville. That’s the halfway point, and if I were a total maniac with a brain ravaged by the poisons of bath salts and carrot cake Oreos, I’d say this turn of events is on par with Hitchcock killing off Janet Leigh in Psycho.

The rest of the movie is a hodgepodge of plot points, the story meandering hither and yon among long-kept secrets, baffling turns of events and displays of toxic masculinity. Also, a mustache which singlehandedly enlivens the proceedings by merely existing within the frame, worn by a new character whose impenetrable presence only serves to submerge most of the film’s emotional content beneath an unconvincing furrowed-brow expression and follicular hilarity. To be fair, the movie is hokey and messy but reasonably watchable and buoyed by an operatic sensibility contributing to its entertainment value, perhaps not in the dramatic manner intended, but effective nonetheless.

Our Call: SKIP IT. The Last Paradiso is reasonably enjoyable in the way its pokerfaced drama teeters into comedy, but its thin characters and haphazard plotting tip it beyond the realm of reasonable recommendation.",5.6,774," Drama, Romance",Positive,0.804

Pictures,Jason Statham Li Bingbing Rainn Wilson Ruby Rose Winston Chao Cliff Curtis,Dean Georgaris Jon Hoeber Erich Hoeber,113,Jon Turteltaub,130000000,530259473,"The Meg is an 2018 American science fiction action film directed by Jon Turteltaub with a screenplay by Dean Georgaris, Jon Hoeber, and Erich Hoeber, loosely based on the 1997 book Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror by Steve Alten. The film stars Jason Statham, Li Bingbing, Rainn Wilson, Ruby Rose and Winston Chao. The film follows a group of scientists who encounter a 75-foot-long (23 m) megalodon shark while on a rescue mission at the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
Walt Disney Studios originally purchased the film rights to the book in the 1990s, but spent several years in development hell. The rights eventually landed at Warner Bros. Pictures, and the film was green-lit in 2015. Turteltaub and much of the cast joined by September 2016, and filming began the following month in New Zealand and Sanya, China, ending in January 2017. The Meg was released in both countries on August 10, 2018, in RealD 3D. It was a box office success and grossed over $530 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with some describing it as entertaining and others calling it ""neither good enough nor bad enough"" to be fun. A sequel, titled Meg 2: The Trench, is in development.","Section: Plot (1):
Rescue diver Jonas Taylor attempts to save the crew of a damaged nuclear submarine when he sees the hull being rammed by an unidentified creature. Two of his crew are trapped in the damaged sub, but Taylor is forced to flee, realizing that attempting rescue would result in the deaths of everyone he has already saved. His account of the story is dismissed by fellow survivor Dr. Heller, who believes that Taylor turned drunk and cowardly due to induced pressure psychosis.
Five years later, billionaire Jack Morris meets Dr. Minway Zhang at an underwater research facility the former financer called Mana One. Zhang and his oceanographer daughter Suyin supervise a mission to explore what could be the deepest section of the Mariana Trench, concealed by a thermocline of hydrogen sulfide. The mission submersible is piloted by Lori, Taylor's ex-wife, accompanied by scientists Toshi and ""The Wall"". They discover an abundance of never-before-seen flora and fauna below the thermocline, but an attack by a large, unidentified creature causes the submersible to lose contact with Mana One. An old friend of Taylor's, Mana One operations manager James ""Mac"" Mackreides, suggests sending Taylor down to attempt a rescue. Despite the objections of Heller, now a member of the Mana One crew, who said that Jonas Taylor had let their friends die in the damaged submarine, Zhang and Mac venture to Thailand to recruit Taylor. He is initially skeptical but relents after listening to a taped recording containing the dialogue between Lori, her crew, and Mana One. Suyin attempts the rescue in their absence but is attacked by a giant squid. Before the squid can crush her submersible, it is killed by a gigantic shark. Taylor, having agreed to help, breaches the thermocline and reaches the sunken submersible. When the shark returns and attacks the submersible before the evacuation has been completed, Toshi sacrifices himself to help the others escape.
Returning to Mana One, the crew discovers the giant shark is a megalodon, or ""meg"". While discussing how to address it, Suyin's daughter Meiying witnesses the shark arriving at the station. The crew realizes that the meg followed them through a temporary break they caused in the thermocline, and resolves to go out and track the meg before killing it with poison. After the meg destroys three nearby ships, Taylor enters the water to shoot the meg with a tracker, then the team puts Suyin in a shark-proof tank so she can shoot the meg with poison. However, the mission goes awry when the shark begins to swallow the cage and cracks Suyin's mask, causing her to lose oxygen. Taylor gets her out just as the meg returns, though it gets snagged on the cage's line and dies from the poison. In their moment of triumph, a second, much larger meg emerges, devouring The Wall and the dead meg, critically wounding Zhang, and destroying the crew's ship. Heller sacrifices himself to save fellow crew member Jaxx. Mac swims out to a floating lifeboat so he and the crew can regroup at Mana One, though Zhang dies on the way. The shark chases them, but it is deterred by a helicopter Morris called in.
Morris claims he has informed all the local governments about the meg and they will handle it, while secretly enlisting a mercenary team to kill the shark with depth charges. Amidst this, Morris is thrown overboard and killed. Learning the government's refusal to help out of disbelief, the Mana One crew resolve to track and kill the shark themselves. The meg attacks a crowded beach in Sanya Bay, China and devours several beach-goers before the Mana One crew use a whale call to divert its attention toward them. Taylor and Suyin work together to kill it, but Suyin is forced to break off to save the others when a helicopter crashing into their ship forces them into the water. Taylor fatally wounds the beast, and attracted by the spilled blood, several smaller sharks approach and devour the dying meg. Taylor rejoins the Mana One crew and considers taking a vacation with Suyin and Meiying. Underwater, the sound of a passing meg is heard, implying that more than two may have escaped the trench.

The rights to the novel were initially acquired by Disney's Hollywood Pictures in 1996. Around that time, Tom Wheeler was hired to adapt the book into a screenplay, but, having decided that his script wasn't good enough, the studio hired Jeffrey Boam to write a new draft. Boam's script was later rejected for the same reason. By 1999 the project had stalled and the rights reverted to Steve Alten, the book's author.In 2005, reports surfaced that the project was being developed by New Line Cinema, with an estimated budget of $75 million, and a slated release of summer 2006. Names attached to the production included Jan de Bont as director, Guillermo Del Toro as producer and Shane Salerno as screenwriter. However, New Line later cancelled the project due to budgetary concerns. The rights reverted to Alten again, but the film remained in development hell.
In 2015, it was announced that the film was now moving forward at Warner Bros., with a new script written by Dean Georgaris. By June of that year, Eli Roth was reported to be in talks to direct, but, due to creative differences, Roth was replaced by Jon Turteltaub in early 2016.

Scientist Augustine Lofthouse has devoted his life work to finding habitable planets where humanity can expand. He meets Jean Sullivan after giving a presentation at a gala and the two form a romantic relationship. After a pregnancy scare, Jean leaves him because of his obsession with work and inability to bond with other human beings. Several years later, Lofthouse encounters her again and she tells him that they have a daughter, whom he chooses not to meet.
Thirty years later, in 2049, nuclear war has wiped out most of the Earth's population and left the surface contaminated with ionizing radiation. Lofthouse refuses to join the evacuation of his Arctic base, knowing he hasn't got long to live due to an unidentified serious illness requiring hemodialysis. He searches the base's computer system for active crewed space missions to warn about the situation on Earth, and finds only one: the interplanetary craft  Aether, returning from an exploration of Jupiter's habitable moon K-23, which Lofthouse discovered. The crew has lost contact with Earth, but do not know why. Lofthouse finds his antenna is too weak to contact them.
He finds he is experiencing mental blackouts.  After a kitchen fire he finds a young girl hiding, who doesn’t speak. He tries to contact the other evacuees to get someone to pick her up, but they are all out of range. The girl communicates by drawing and tells him her name is Iris. He grows fond of her and takes her with him on a snowmobile to another base farther north, which has a larger, more powerful antenna. He loses his dialysis equipment, condemning him to die soon. Arriving at the base, he manages to make contact with Aether, but the crew is interrupted by an asteroid field that damages the ship's radar and communication systems.
To fix the damage, pregnant mission specialist Sully and her partner, Commander Adewole, conduct a spacewalk with their flight engineer Maya. They fix the comms and radar but are caught in the middle of a second asteroid strike that fatally injures Maya. Sully reaches out to Lofthouse, who tells her not to return to Earth, but go back to K-23 and start a new life there. Aether's pilot, Tom Mitchell, refuses, but upon discovering his wife's final words and seeing the state of Earth's atmosphere, understands that it is in the crew's best interests to go back to Jupiter's moon. Still, he decides to use one of the two  re-entry vehicles to go back to Earth, hoping to find his family who may have been evacuated to temporary safety. Sanchez, who saw Maya as a second daughter, decides to accompany him and bury her body.
In her final communication, Sully tells Lofthouse that he was one of the reasons why she joined NASA. She thanks him, telling him her mother Jean knew him, as he had given her a moon rock, and that her full name is Iris Sullivan. Lofthouse says he already knew her name, making it clear that the young Iris he saw was a hallucination. When asked how he ended up at the base he contacted Aether from, he says he thought he might be able to help someone, hinting that the reason that he kept track of Aether's mission was not just because he discovered the moon it went to, but also because he knew Sully was his daughter and that she was a part of that mission. Before heading out into the cold unprotected to die, Lofthouse tells Sully he's proud to have finally met her and Sully describes K-23 to him. Sully and Adewole are left to return to K-23 using a course provided to them by Lofthouse to give humanity a second start.

The Midnight Sky received some praise for its ""ambition and emotional tone,"" though was compared unfavorably to other science fiction films. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 51% of 241 reviews of the film were positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critics consensus states, ""The Midnight Sky lacks the dramatic heft to match its narrative scale, but its flaws are often balanced by thoughtful themes and a poignant performance from director-star George Clooney."" According to Metacritic, which sampled 42 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, the film received ""mixed or average reviews"".Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote ""There's a lot that’s frustrating about George Clooney's new film The Midnight Sky, from its egregious borrowing from any number of better movies to its pacing issues, but thanks to a few grace notes, its shortcomings are mostly forgivable."" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B and described it as ""a dystopian drama whose fluctuating tone—grim, with flickers of hopeful sentiment—feels almost comfortingly familiar, if a little on the nose for 2020.""The Wall Street Journal reviewer Joe Morganstern gave the film a warm review, but added: ""The film isn't perfect. The narrative piles crisis upon crisis, from a fat fire in the observatory kitchen to spectacular repair efforts in space and a startling sequence that involves droplets of blood. The pace, paradoxically, can be awfully slow, but it may seem less so to home viewers with plenty of time and patience; the metabolic rate of motion pictures will be changing in the streaming era, to an extent we can't foresee."" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com reviewed the film more harshly and gave it two stars, concluding, ""The heart of this movie just isn't there. It's as weightless as space.""

The plot follows a Roman Catholic priest and a nun in her novitiate as they uncover an unholy secret in 1952 Romania.
Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema announced The Nun, a spin-off film to The Conjuring 2, which had opened five days earlier, with Safran and Wan producing. The initial script for the film was written by David Leslie Johnson. Hardy had signed on to direct The Nun with a new screenplay from Wan and Dauberman. Principal photography began in May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania, and during filming, the set was blessed by a Roman Catholic clergyman.The Nun was released in the United States on September 7, 2018, by Warner Bros.

It grossed $365 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series. A sequel is currently in development with Akela Cooper penning the script and James Wan and Peter Safran co-producing the project.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1952 Romania, two nuns living at the Saint Cartha's monastery are attacked by an unseen evil force after entering a tunnel to retrieve an ancient Christian relic. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria, flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Frenchie, a villager who transports supplies to the nuns.
The Vatican learns of the incident and summons Father Burke to Rome, where they ask him to travel with Sister Irene, a nun in her novitiate, to Romania in order to investigate the situation. While Sister Irene is teaching children the relationship between religion and science in a school, her Mother Superior interrupts her and informs her that Burke has arrived in order to request Irene's accompaniment in his trip to Romania.
The pair travels to Romania and meets with Frenchie, who leads them to the abbey. They discover Victoria's body and take a key from her corpse. Inside, they encounter the Abbess, who informs them that the nuns observe a period of silence during the night and offers them lodging at the attached convent if they wish to return tomorrow. Frenchie is attacked by a demon as he returns to the village, but escapes. Burke tells Irene that a boy he exorcised in the past, Daniel, was fatally injured during the ritual, and Burke has carried the burden of the boy's death with him ever since. Irene reveals that as a girl, she had visions and each of them concluded with ""Mary points the way"", causing the Church to take an interest in her. That night, Burke is rescued by Irene after being buried alive in the graveyard by the demonic entity.
The next day, Irene and Burke return to the abbey, but only Irene can enter as it is cloistered. She meets some of the other nuns and learns that they are praying constantly, swapping in shifts, to keep the evil entity at bay. Sister Oana reveals the abbey's history: it was built in the Middle Ages as a castle by a duke obsessed with the occult. The duke summoned the demon through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with a vial filled with the Blood of Christ. However, the bombings during World War II accidentally reopened the rift, unleashing the evil entity once more. Burke identifies the demon as Valak and discovers the Abbess has been dead all along.
Frenchie heads back to the abbey to help Irene and Burke. Irene is attacked by Valak and joins the nuns in desperate prayer to ward off the demon. When the group reunites, Irene discovers that none of the nuns she had seen and talked to were real and she had been praying alone, later realizing that Victoria had been the last nun in the abbey and had sacrificed herself to stop Valak from possessing her body and unleashing evil.
Theorizing that Valak can only be stopped if they seal the rift with the blood of Christ contained in the reliquary, the trio retrieves the vial with the key Victoria possessed. Irene then informs Burke that God has called her to make her solemn vows as a nun and asks Burke to elevate her to the status of a professed nun, which he does in the abbey's chapel.
After the trio unlocks the tunnel door, Irene is lured into a pentagram and possessed by Valak. Frenchie smears some of the blood of Christ on her face, casting out the demon. Burke is wounded by Daniel's ghost as Valak starts to drown Irene in a flooded chamber. Irene expels the blood of Christ in the demon's face, banishing it as the blood of Christ seals the rift. After Frenchie resuscitates Irene, he reveals his real name is Maurice. Unbeknownst to the others, Maurice has been possessed by Valak, as evidenced by an inverted cross on his neck.
Twenty years later at a university seminar, in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Carolyn Perron watches as Ed and Lorraine Warren present footage of their attempt to exorcise a possessed Maurice. In the footage, Maurice grabs Lorraine, giving her visions of Ed dying, which initiates the Warrens' investigation of the Perron farmhouse haunting.

",,"Mar Targarona is a tricky filmmaker, and in the middle stretch of her Spanish-language concentration camp drama, “The Photographer of Mauthausen” (now on Netflix), she pulls something of a bait and switch.

The opening scenes provide what we’ve come to expect from these stories: an inventory of barbaric rituals, the dramatization of heartbreaking separations and moments of sudden, bloody brutality. We meet Francesc (Mario Casas), a Spanish communist prisoner who has made himself useful as assistant to the camp photographer (Richard van Weyden). He does this work to stay alive but knows he is complicit in a propaganda operation. When he is ordered, in the last days of the war, to destroy the camp’s photos, he and his fellow prisoners realize they must protect them as evidence.

Their carefully coordinated attempts to smuggle those negatives out of the camp is closer to “The Great Escape” than to “Schindler’s List,” resulting in deceptions, distractions, close calls and a suspense sequence with a hidden film strip that’s downright Hitchcockian. But just as the viewer relaxes into such genre-adjacent pleasures, Targarona wallops us with a pair of chilling scenes, dramatizations of pure evil, served up as reminders that the horrors of this time and place cannot, and will not, be trivialized.

Such tonal shifts aren’t always easy to sustain, and occasionally Targarona lets the picture get away from her (particularly the ending, which lays it on a little thick). But she builds her beats well, and the cinematography is striking: Taking cues from the photographs in question, she uses a muted color palette to hint at the desaturation of those black-and-white images.

Targarona began as an actor before becoming a producer and, finally, a director. “The Photographer of Mauthausen” is her second feature, but if feels like the work of an old pro — vivid, involving and frequently terrifying.",6.7,8639,"Biography,Drama,History",Positive,0.677

The film was a co-production of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland.
The Pianist premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival on 24 May 2002, where it won the Palme d'Or, and went into wide release that September; the film received widespread critical acclaim, with critics lauding Polanski's direction, Brody's performance and Harwood's screenplay.

It was included in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century in 2016.","Section: Plot (1):
In September 1939, Władysław Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist, is playing live on the radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during the Nazi German invasion of Poland. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when he learns that Britain and France have declared war on Germany, but the promised aid does not come. Fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German and Soviet armies invading Poland at the same time on different fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled General Government. Jews are soon prevented from working or owning businesses, and are also made to wear blue Star of David armbands.
By November 1940, Szpilman and his family are forced from their home into the isolated and overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto, where conditions only get worse. People starve, the SS guards are brutal, starving children are abandoned and there are dead bodies everywhere. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the SS kill an entire family in an apartment across the street during a round-up, including dumping a man in a wheelchair out a window.
On 16 August 1942, Szpilman and his family are about to be transported to Treblinka extermination camp as part of Operation Reinhard. But a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police recognizes Władysław at the Umschlagplatz, and separates him from his family. He becomes a slave labourer, and learns of a coming Jewish revolt. He helps the resistance by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, on one occasion narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. Szpilman eventually manages to escape, and goes into hiding with help from a non-Jewish friend, Andrzej Bogucki, and his wife, Janina.
In April 1943, Szpilman watches from his window as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which he aided, unfolds, and then ultimately fails. After a neighbor discovers Szpilman in the flat, he is forced to flee to a second hiding place. The new room has a piano in it, but he is compelled to keep quiet, while beginning to suffer from jaundice. 
In August 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army attacks a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. Tank shells hit the apartment, forcing him to flee. Over the course of the following months, Warsaw is destroyed. Szpilman is left alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. He eventually makes his way to a house where he finds a can of pickled cucumbers. While trying to open it, he is noticed by Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns that Szpilman is a pianist. He asks Szpilman to play on a grand piano in the house. The decrepit Szpilman manages to play Chopin's Ballade in G minor. Hosenfeld lets Szpilman hide in the attic of the empty house. Whilst there, he is regularly supplied with food by the German officer.
In January 1945, the Germans are retreating from the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the last time, promising he will listen to him on Polish Radio after the war. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm and leaves. In Spring 1945, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp pass by a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. Hosenfeld, being one of the prisoners, overhears a released inmate lamenting over his former career as a violinist. He asks him whether he knows Szpilman, which he confirms, and Hosenfeld says he helped Szpilman and begs him to tell Szpilman he is in the camp. Later the violinist and Szpilman reach the prisoners camp but find it abandoned.
After the war, Szpilman is back at the Polish Radio, where he performs Chopin's ""Grand Polonaise brillante"" to a large prestigious audience. An epilogue states that Szpilman died in 2000 at the age of 88, and all that is known of Hosenfeld is he died in 1952, still in Soviet captivity.

The story had deep connections with director Roman Polanski because he escaped from the Kraków Ghetto as a child after the death of his mother. He ended up living in a Polish farmer's barn until the war's end. His father almost died in the camps, but they reunited after the end of World War II.Joseph Fiennes was Polanski's first choice for the lead role, but he turned it down due to a previous commitment to a theatrical role. Over 1,400 actors auditioned for the role of Szpilman at a casting call in London. Unsatisfied with all who tried, Polanski sought to cast Adrien Brody, whom he saw as ideal for the role during their first meeting in Paris.Principal photography on The Pianist began on 9 February 2001 in Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany. The Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city were recreated on the backlot of Babelsberg Studio as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet Army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway.The first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks. Soon after, the film crew moved to a villa in Potsdam, which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, Germany. The scenes that featured German soldiers destroying a Warsaw hospital with flamethrowers were filmed here. On 15 March, filming finally moved to Babelsberg Studios. The first scene shot at the studio was the complex and technically demanding scene in which Szpilman witnesses the ghetto uprising.Filming at the studios ended on 26 March, and moved to Warsaw on 29 March. The rundown district of Praga was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built onto these original buildings, re-creating World War II–era Poland with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The Umschlagplatz scene where Szpilman, his family, and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the extermination camps was filmed at the National Defence University of Warsaw.Principal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production in Paris.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a positive review of the film, noting that, ""perhaps that impassive quality reflects what [director Roman] Polanski wants to say. ... By showing Szpilman as a survivor, but not a fighter or a hero—as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and the kindness of a few non-Jews—Polanski is reflecting ... his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never healed."" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune said that the film ""is the best dramatic feature I've seen on the Holocaust experience, so powerful a statement on war, inhumanity, and art's redemption that it may signal Polanski's artistic redemption"". He would later go on to say that the film ""illustrates that theme and proves that Polanski's own art has survived the chaos of his life—and the hell that war and bigotry once made of it"". Richard Schickel of Time magazine called it a ""raw, unblinkable film"", and said that, ""We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears, our sympathies."" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the film ""contains moments of irony, of ambiguity, and of strange beauty, as when we finally get a look at Warsaw and see a panorama of destruction, a world of color bombed into black-and-white devastation"". He also said that, ""In the course of showing us a struggle for survival, in all its animal simplicity, Polanski also gives us humanity, in all its complexity."" A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that Szpilman ""comes to resemble one of Samuel Beckett's gaunt existential clowns, shambling through a barren, bombed-out landscape clutching a jar of pickles. He is like the walking punchline to a cosmic jest of unfathomable cruelty."" He also felt that ""Szpilman's encounter, in the war's last days, with a music-loving German officer, ""courted sentimentality by associating the love of art with moral decency, an equation the Nazis themselves, steeped in Beethoven and Wagner, definitively refuted"".

It was released under the Screen Gems label and received generally negative reviews from critics, but grossed $3 worldwide.","Section: Plot (1):
During an exorcism ritual, the possessed Hannah Grace almost kills the priest by choking him while suspended in midair. Her father, Grainger, then suffocates her to death using a pillow, and as she dies the priest drops to the floor gasping for breath. As her father sobs over her dead body, a fly lands on her hand and it twitches ominously.
Three months later, Megan Reed, an ex-cop with the Boston Police Department struggles with depression and an addiction to pills after her patrol partner was shot dead by a criminal whom she failed to subdue. Megan's friend Lisa Roberts finds her a nightshift job in the Boston Metro Hospital's morgue, located in an intimidating brutalist architecture building (portrayed by Boston City Hall). During Megan's first shift, a man (later identified as Grainger) aggressively tries to convince her to let him into the building, but she denies and informs the two security guards Ernie Gainor and Dave. However, shortly after, Megan helps EMT Randy to move the corpse of a brutally murdered young woman (later identified as the one of Hannah Grace) into the building and the man secretly enters the building. Randy tells Megan a man stabbed Hannah  to death and was then caught in the act trying to burn her body in an alleyway.
When Megan tries to fingerprint and photograph Hannah's corpse, the camera explodes and the fingerprints return as illegible by the computer. Other strange things occur and Megan becomes more suspicious of the corpse. Megan subsequently researches on the internet only to find out that Hannah had died during an exorcism. She also notices that Hannah's bright blue eye color does not match the one listed on her driver's license. Megan soon encounters Grainger who had invaded the building trying to drag Hannah's corpse through the building. Alongside with the two security guards Ernie and Dave, Megan manages to subdue Grainger.The latter screams Hannah's corpse must be burnt because she isn't really dead, but they do not listen to him and have him arrested by the police.
Megan's ex-boyfriend, Andrew Kurtz, is still employed as an officer and responds to the scene. He agrees to help Megan identify the corpse after she tells him about the color of Hannah's eyes. Soon after, Andrew tells Megan that Hannah Grace had died three months earlier and asked Megan whether the given finger prints was Hannah's. Megan confirmed it and Andrew thought maybe there is some error in the computer data. Meanwhile, Hannah kills Dave by telekinetically lifting his body across the ceiling and into her refrigerated drawer in the morgue where she breaks his body. Soon after, Megan notice that some of the wound on Hannah is missing, as if it had healed by itself. Investigating the security footage, Megan sees a glimpse of Hannah's corpse crawling around in the building. She shows the footage to Lisa who does not believe her and accuses her of having a relapse on her addiction to pills. Lisa is killed by Hannah soon after. When Randy returns to the morgue to deliver another corpse, Megan shows Randy the healing body of Hannah. 
After Randy leaves the Morgue, Megan notices that the lift closes by itself and is going down. Megan investigates the security footage and sees a glimpse of Hannah's body crawling inside the lift. She rushes down to the access bay to warn Randy, but Hannah has already killed him. Suddenly, Andrew calls Megan to warn her that Grainger has escaped police custody after killing the two officers transporting him. Moments later, Grainger forces Megan to take him to Hannah's body at gunpoint. Grainger explains to Megan that he is Hannah's father. He tells her that numerous exorcisms failed because the demon possessing her was too strong. So strong, in fact, that it is even able to possess Hannah's body after her death by killing people to heal itself. He tells her that Hannah had depression and it worsened until the demon was able to enter Hannah's body. The blue eye color is the sign of the demon possessing Hannah.  Grainger wonders why Hannah killed Dave and Lisa, but did not kill Megan. Megan agrees to help Grainger cremate Hannah, but she reanimates and pushes Grainger into the fire. Then she locks Megan inside her refrigerated drawer.
Andrew and Ernie come to Megan's help. Hannah kills Ernie and then tries to kill Andrew, but Megan forces herself to be calm. She picks up Andrew's firearm and shoots Hannah, then drags her to the crematorium while Andrew calls for backup. After a brief struggle before the incinerator, Megan pushes Hannah into the fire, eventually killing the demon. As the movie comes to a close, Megan recounts how she has managed to stay clean for over two months. As she looks into the mirror at her reflection, a single fly-similar to the ones shown in several scenes involving Hannah's corpse earlier in the film-lands on the mirror's surface. Megan promptly smashes it with her hand as the movie ends, leading the audience to wonder whether the fly's appearance is simple coincidence, if Hannah's demon has somehow transferred her essence, in whole or in part, into Megan herself, or simply symbolic that Megan is strong enough to fight her depression, thus not letting any possessive demon to enter her body.

A sequel to The Princess Switch, it stars Vanessa Hudgens, Sam Palladio, Suanne Braun, and Nick Sagar. The story follows Margaret Delacourt, the Duchess of Montenaro, who suddenly inherits the throne to her home country of Montenaro. As her Christmas coronation approaches, she and Stacy switch places once again so Margaret can fix her relationship with Stacy's friend Kevin. Unbeknownst to both women, a third look-alike, Margaret's evil cousin Lady Fiona, disguises herself as Margaret in a scheme to steal the throne.The film is produced by Brad Krevoy and was released on Netflix on November 19, 2020 and received positive reviews from critics.","Section: Plot (1):
Set two years after the first film, Stacy is now the Princess of Belgravia, while Margaret is preparing to ascend to the throne of Montenaro following the death of the king and the decision of his son Howard to abdicate. Nervous about taking on the responsibilities of ruling a nation, Margaret has ended her relationship with Kevin, who is now running his own bakery with Olivia in Chicago. 
Stacy makes a surprise visit on her way to the coronation and finds Kevin miserable since the breakup. When Olivia reveals she never mailed in the RSVP to the coronation, Stacy persuades him to reconsider and travel with her and Prince Edward, even though they have their own relationship problems as Stacy has increasingly neglected Edward while she focuses on her duties as Princess.
Upon arriving, Kevin reunites with Margaret and helps her, Prince Edward, Stacy, and Olivia decorate her palace for Christmas. Margaret also feels depressed about how things ended up. At an evening event, they dance, only to be interrupted by Lady Fiona Pembroke, Margaret's cousin. Unbeknownst to anyone, Fiona has spent nearly all of her family's small fortune and has resorted to use her servants Reggie and Mindy to rob the guests at the party. Back at the decrepit Pembroke estate, Fiona suddenly has an idea to assume Margaret's identity, get crowned as queen, and loot the royal treasury, setting her up for life. Reggie and Mindy are enthusiastic and help Fiona dye her hair and copy Margaret's makeup while studying the queen's upcoming schedule.
Back at the palace, Margaret admits that she's been too busy with royal affairs to spend time with Kevin. Complicating matters further is Count Antonio Rossi, her chief of staff, who woos Margaret and plants seeds of doubt in Kevin's mind that he could ever be a good match for a future queen. Stacy decides the only way to fix things is for her and Margaret to switch identities again so she and Kevin can have the afternoon to themselves while Stacy takes care of Margaret's schedule. The switch takes place, with Olivia staying behind to distract Edward while Margaret and Kevin go to a local Christmas park. There, Kevin expresses his doubts about being Margaret's equal and she convinces him that such concerns are irrelevant: as long as they love each other.
Reggie and Mindy abduct Stacy, thinking she's Margaret, and lock her up in Pembroke Manor. Fiona steps in just as Margaret returns; realizing that the woman she's speaking to isn't Stacy, Margaret explains the truth to Prince Edward and they rescue Stacy from Reggie and Mindy, who are arrested and reveal Fiona's plan. Meanwhile, Antonio deduces the truth on his own as Fiona forgot to cover up a tattoo on her finger. He tells her that he will move up the coronation and help her escape the country if she agrees to divide the treasury with him, as he also needs money. Just as the coronation is about to take place, Margaret and Stacy arrive and expose Fiona and Antonio; the latter is arrested while the former admits her deception and reveals that Kevin is on his way to the airport with Olivia after she told him she didn't want to be with him anymore. 
They stop Kevin just as he is about to board a plane and he and Margaret get married on the spot by a nearby priest. Stacy and Edward reaffirm their love for each other as she promises to make more time for them and he promises not to smother her with attention. Margaret is crowned Queen of Montenaro with Stacy, Edward, Olivia, and Fiona (escorted by police) cheering her on.

The film stars Meryl Streep, James Corden, Nicole Kidman, Keegan-Michael Key, Andrew Rannells, Ariana DeBose, Kerry Washington, and introducing Jo Ellen Pellman as Emma Nolan.
The Prom had a limited theatrical release on December 4, 2020, prior to streaming on Netflix on December 11, 2020. The film received mixed reviews from critics praising the musical numbers, cast performances, moral, production values, and faithfulness to its source material, but mostly criticizing the narrative, characterizations, and stereotypes.","Section: Plot (1):
In Edgewater, Indiana, head of the James Madison High School PTA Mrs. Greene announces the school's prom will be canceled because female student Emma Nolan wanted to take a girl to the dance, defying their traditional beliefs and much to the dismay of Principal Tom Hawkins, who supports Emma.
Meanwhile, in New York City, narcissistic Broadway stars Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman are disappointed after their show Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Story closes on opening night due to negative reviews. They are comforted by Trent Oliver, a Juilliard graduate who is between acting jobs, and Angie Dickinson, a performer who has just quit her part in the chorus of Chicago. They realize Dee Dee and Barry need a cause to seem caring and selfless. After finding Emma's story on Twitter, they drive to Indiana with the cast of Godspell and publicist Sheldon Saperstein.
At school, Emma is bullied and harassed by Kaylee, Shelby, Nick, and Kevin for being a lesbian and for the cancellation of the prom. The actors barge into the next PTA meeting in favor of Emma and while Mrs. Greene is furious, Hawkins reveals he is a big fan of Dee Dee. Emma and her secretly closeted girlfriend, Alyssa, Mrs. Greene's daughter, meet in private and talk about Alyssa coming out to her mother.
The actors arrive at a motel and perform at a monster truck rally event, but are booed off the stage. Hawkins tells them the Indiana Supreme Court wants the school to hold a prom for Emma and invites Dee Dee to have dinner with him at Applebee's, where the pair bond.
The next day, a number of promposals occur and Kaylee and Shelby find out about Alyssa's plan to come out. At the house of Emma's grandmother Bea, she reveals that Emma was kicked out by her parents at sixteen when she came out, and Barry tells her he left his house before his parents had the chance to do the same to him.
Afterward, it is revealed that the PTA arranged a separate prom for her, with the real prom being held at a private club. A furious Emma calls Alyssa, who tells her she did not know and she is not ready to come out yet. Dee Dee accidentally reveals they came to Indiana to improve their image, leaving Principal Hawkins disappointed with her.
The next day, Mrs. Greene addresses the media frenzy that followed the separate proms. While Angie comforts a heartbroken Emma, Barry tells Dee Dee to get Emma on her ex-husband Eddie Sharp's show while she tells him to call his mother Vera but they both are reluctant. Dee Dee meets up and apologizes to Hawkins and they reconcile. Emma meets up with Alyssa and breaks up with her, despite her apology.
Trent confronts Kaylee, Shelby, Nick, Kevin, and three unnamed students and persuades them to support Emma with help from the Godspell cast. They agree to apologize to Emma. Dee Dee arrives at the motel and tells everyone she agreed to give away her house in The Hamptons in order to get Emma on Eddie's show. She turns this offer down to tell her story her own way and sings a song she wrote during a livestream, which goes viral online.
Realizing they truly care for her, the actors decide to throw her an inclusive prom themselves and contribute to the budget, including Dee Dee with her American Express Card. Afterward, Dee Dee tells Barry she called Vera, who wants to talk to him. Vera tells Barry that although she cannot undo what she did, she always wanted a relationship with him, and they make up. Kaylee, Shelby, Nick, and Kevin show up at the gym and apologize to Alyssa and Emma. Mrs. Greene also arrives to stop the preparations for the prom, but Alyssa finally comes out to her mother and Mrs. Greene leaves silently. Alyssa and Emma reconcile.
Later that night, Emma and Alyssa show up early to meet with the actors, Sheldon, Bea, and Vera. Angie receives a message asking her to play Roxie Hart because Tina Louise has shingles, Trent signs on to be the school's drama teacher, and Barry is crowned prom queen while Dee Dee and Principal Hawkins share a kiss and start a relationship. The students and many teens from the LGBT community show up for support. After the prom begins, Mrs. Greene arrives, apologizes, and embraces Alyssa, accepting her for who she is. Emma and Alyssa finally share a public kiss and everyone celebrates.

","hatsHats off to Ryan Murphy: The man is consistently contradictory. Just a few weeks after Ratched hit Netflix, his adaptation of the 2018 Broadway musical The Prom arrives to the platform gussied up in a technicolor version of the same worshipful high school nostalgia as Glee, and riddled with the same condescension toward “average” people that has defined so much of his output, from Nip/Tuck to The Politician. Murphy’s fondness for smashing down the walls surrounding certain American institutions and making them available for all to enjoy has never been particularly nuanced, and he directs The Prom with the same bluntness. The film’s ultimate admiration of celebrity is only vaguely tolerable because its concurrent message of inclusivity is theoretically admirable — but must it be delivered by the likes of a thoroughly exhausting, irredeemably self-satisfied James Corden?

The event that inspired the musical The Prom, which ran as a stage musical on Broadway from November 2018 through August 2019 and was supposed to start a national tour next year before COVID-19 changed how we live, became enough of a national-news story that it has its own Wikipedia page: the “2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy.” Mississippi high school student Constance McMillen’s desire to bring her girlfriend to prom was met with a hostile school board who canceled the prom once the ACLU became involved. The situation dragged on for weeks, and to discuss in too much detail the subsequent actions of bigoted parents and harassing students would give away many of the twists and turns in The Prom, which to some degree follows what actually happened to McMillen. Murphy, in turn, adapts the play fairly closely, enlisting Chad Beguelin and Bob Martin (who worked on the lyrics and book of the play) as screenwriters.

The Prom introduces Emma Nolan (Jo Ellen Pellman), McMillen’s analogue, in an opening scene that makes plain what she is up against. In Edgewater, Indiana, the PTA meeting led by Mrs. Greene (Kerry Washington, continuing her Little Fires Everywhere turn with another against-type role), during which the parents choose to cancel the prom instead of exposing their precious children to their classmate who happens to be a lesbian, is a real-life pit of despair. “We have no choice,” Mrs. Greene sanctimoniously says. Then The Prom pivots us to New York City, where two-time Tony winner Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep) and perpetual runner-up Barry Glickman (James Corden) are shocked that their new musical about Eleanor Roosevelt is met with negative reviews. “I put on that wig and those prosthetic teeth and know I’m changing lives,” Dee Dee said to a reporter on the red carpet, and that arrogance is what convinces Dee Dee, Barry, fellow down-on-his-luck actor Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells), and unemployed Chicago chorus girl Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman) to seize Emma’s narrative as an opportunity and march arm in arm down a heavily CGI-ed Broadway to celebrate their philanthropic The con, they decide, is to “appear to be decent human beings” by traveling to middle America and injecting themselves into Emma’s fight against the PTA. Each of the four, who varyingly identify as gay or, as Dee Dee puts it, “gay-positive,” has their own motivations. Trent is appearing in a traveling show that will pass through Indiana. Angie is genuinely moved by Emma’s story. Barry is reminded of his own traumatic experience with the prom and wants to give Emma the night he didn’t have. Dee Dee sees a way to bolster her brand and snag herself a third Tony. And so they all swoop into Edgewater (which is shown sometimes as rustically tiny and sometimes as large enough to support a gigantic mall and country club), proudly declare themselves liberal elites in a “hick town,” and align themselves with Emma and her school principal ally Mr. Hawkins (Keegan-Michael Key). “We’re gonna help that little lesbian whether she likes it or not!” is their rallying cry. Of course, because The Prom is a fantasy, there is no real chance of “or not.”

Emma immediately befriends these four adults, going along with their campy antics and performative advice. Does Emma actually have any interest in theater? Unclear! But in typical musical fashion, the lines between reality and stage constantly blur, resulting in moments that run the gamut from enjoyably spunky to deeply torturous.

Emma’s first number, “Just Breathe,” sung as she walks through her high school and observes “Note to self: people suck in Indiana,” is an opportunity for Pellman to step forward into the limelight. As an actress, she’s a winning find whose earnestness strengthens The Prom — she shines in practically every pairing, especially when teamed up with Kidman for “Zazz.” Kidman’s Angie, who has longed for years to play Roxie Hart with no success, delivers attitude advice to Pellman’s Emma with an array of high kicks. And Pellman has nice chemistry with classmate Alyssa (Ariana DeBose), a straight-A student, debate team champion, and cheerleader who is hiding her own secret; their duet “Dance With You” is evocative of a certain groundbreaking romance that Murphy delivered on Glee. spirit.  But the issue with the cast’s exuberance — Streep digging into Dee Dee’s flirty vibe with Key’s Mr. Hawkins; Rannells clearly relishing how often Trent self-absorbedly mentions his past training at Juilliard — is how much that papier-mâché’s over many of the film’s strange technical choices (why so many floating cameras?) and the script’s narrative shortcuts. Most confusing is the film’s contrasting messages about individual happiness and communal acceptance. For the most part, The Prom wants to affirm viewers of their moral rightness by insulting the pervasiveness of small-minded cruelty and mocking how fervently people stick to misguided stereotypes. So many of the Broadway actors’ songs lean into this perspective, and to be fair, are some of the film’s best-shot performances. (Rannells’ “Love Thy Neighbor,” in which he chastises Emma’s classmates for their Christianity-excused hypocrisy at the town’s mall, chasing them up and down the escalator and breaking into a dance routine near the mall’s central fountain, is satisfyingly sarcastic.) But The Prom pivots in its final third — did I mention this movie is 133 minutes?! — into a tidy parable about forgiveness, a cloying narrative turn that begs us to pity James Corden, which I cannot, and will not, do.

Certain elements of The Prom can be forgiven if you frame the musical as a fantasy, and if you can accept the superficiality of its happy ending, and if you allow yourself to be swept up in Streep, Kidman, and Key’s enthusiasm, and if you can empathize with Pellman’s Emma and the simplicity of her desire to share a dance with her crush in spite of intolerant bullies who put scissoring teddy bears in her locker. But Corden is the distraction that derails every scene he’s in, and unluckily for us, he’s in many of them. There’s never a sense that Corden is actually becoming Barry Glickman, but rather like he’s doing a Late Late Show bit. Besides a Southern accent that comes and goes, he’s playing a gay character without exuding any believable sexual energy; has no spark with Streep’s Dee Dee, who inexplicably goes from professional rival to close friend; and brings a noticeable disingenuousness to moments that require intense emoting. That final shortcoming is the most damaging, and makes it so neither Barry’s investment in getting Emma to prom nor his decision to reconnect with people from his past leaves much of an impression. There’s too much of Corden to ignore in The Prom, but there isn’t much to like.

“One thing you’ve taught me is how much people enjoy a show,” Emma says to Dee Dee, Barry, Angie, and Trent, and that describes The Prom overall. Hidden by the neon lights, glittering sequins, and A-list cast willing to indulge in Murphy’s hijinks is another project that can’t decide between sincerity and contempt, and that will ultimately leave you unsatisfied.",6,22740," Comedy, Drama, Musical ",Positive,0.666

The crux of this film is the belief of one of the lead characters in positive thinking which re-ignites the spirits of the second lead character and her family.
The story is set in New Orleans. Miranda Wells (Katie Holmes) is a hard-working young widow struggling to raise three children. There's a storm brewing in the area. She works for a fish shop owned by Tucker (Jerry O'Connell) who is also her boyfriend. 
Bray Johnson (Josh Lucas) is an engineering professor from Vanderbilt University looking to meet Miranda to deliver a package. 
Bray visits Miranda's house to drop off a letter but she's not home, he speaks only to her son Greg Wells (Aidan Pierce Brennan), and decides to come back later.
While driving back home, after picking up her two daughters, older Missy Wells (Sarah Hoffmeister) and younger Bess Wells (Chloe Lee) from school, Miranda hits a truck whose driver turns out to be Bray. Bray offers to fix the broken bumper for Miranda and as they drive back realises that it is the same Miranda he came looking for. Bray and Greg fix the car bumper. 
There's a hurricane brewing in the background. The family readies for dinner inviting Bray as well, with the younger Bess wanting pizza and Miranda feeling bad not being able to provide it. Bray then stresses on positive thinking and its power and maybe there could be pizza. There's a knock on the door by pizza delivery, from Tucker. This event will be the first of the many positive things happening in Miranda's life.
While Bray prepares to leave, he starts to bring up the envelope (the reason why he's there in the first place) but the kids scream and she leaves. Bray leaves the envelope in the postbox.
That night the hurricane gets really bad and a tree log falls through and creates a hole through the roof. The family is scared and shelters in the bathroom, which is the safest place. The next morning, the family mulls over their bad luck, as usual. Bray comes over to check on them and offers to fix the roof as best as he can. Miranda's mother-in-law Bobby (Celia Weston) drops by also to check on the family and is very wary of Bray from the start. Miranda and the kids leave with Bobby to stay over at Bobby's house while the house is fixed. On the way, they drop by to visit Tucker, who also comes to know about Bray and feels a little threatened and insecure.
The next day, the family goes back to the house that Bray has fixed, all very happy. The garage is still blocked by a fallen tree which also Bray offers to clear up. That evening there's a dinner at Tucker's restaurant where he proposes to Miranda, which she reluctantly accepts. Bobby offers to stay with the kids that night so Tucker and Miranda can be alone. The next day as Bray is clearing the logs from the broken tree, Missy and him have a conversation about her birthday celebration the next day. Bray motivates her to find something to celebrate with her friends that made her happy. They decide on taffy when Miranda drives back in her new car, a gift from Tucker.
At the birthday party, Bobby brings up a news article about an invention with Bray's photo on it. The invention was also something Miranda's late husband was also linked to. Bobby assumes that Bray stole the invention and Miranda confronts Bray. He explains that him and her husband were working on it together but on the fateful plane crash he died and Bray survived. Bray tries to eplain as best as he can that his sole purpose was to give a copy of the patent. But Miranda is heartbroken that Bray didn't talk about it earlier, feels Bray's concern was more sympathy than empathy, asks him to leave.
Bray leaves, and sends a copy to Miranda the next day. Miranda is overwhelmed with the figure involved in the patent, chats with the kids about their money problems going away, Miranda wanting to pursue her nursing career. Greg now tells Miranda about Brays first visit. The family finally starts to relax with Missy getting a computer as a bday present, going out for dinner. They discover the washed away mail box with the original copy of the patent, which made Bray being honest about his intentions. Bray goes back to Knoxville but still aching to speak to Miranda. Miranda calls off her engagement with Tucker after realizing she does not truly love him and quits her job.
A few days later, Miranda ends up at Brays house to clear the air and meets with his sister, who exclaims that Bray has gone to Miranda's house. Later that day, while driving back, they chat over the phone about this funny incident and finally meetup at a WAFFLE house, embracing each other with warmth and genuine affection. The next shot is everyone at Bray's house putting up a Christmas tree. There a honk at the door and when the family goes out to check on it, they see a pony (Bess's wish) and a happy, whole, positive family.

An international co-production between the United Kingdom, United States, Sweden, and Japan, the story is based on the novel of the same name by Jo Nesbø. The film stars Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Val Kilmer, and J. K. Simmons, and follows inspector Harry Hole as he tracks a serial killer who builds snowmen at his crime scenes.
Principal photography began on 18 January 2016 in Norway, before moving to London and Sweden. The film premiered on 7 October 2017 at the Haifa International Film Festival, and was theatrically released by Universal Pictures, on 13 October 2017 in the United Kingdom and 20 October 2017 in the United States. The film was a box office bomb, grossing $43 million worldwide against a $35 million budget, and it was widely panned by critics, who called it ""clichéd and uninvolving."" Some consider it to be one of the worst films ever made. Alfredson later attributed many of the film's problems to the film's rushed production schedule, claiming that 15-20% of the film's story was never shot.","Section: Plot (1):
At a remote cabin, a boy and his mother, Sarah, are visited by his abusive biological father, a police officer named Jonas. Jonas strikes and sexually assaults Sarah, who threatens to tell Jonas's wife about their illegitimate son. Jonas leaves and Sarah follows in her car with her son. During the chase, she drifts into a catatonic state, letting go of the steering wheel. The boy escapes as the car crashes into a lake. Despite his pleading, his mother remains seated and sinks.
Years later, Harry Hole is an inspector with the Norwegian Police Service's Oslo district. He struggles with alcoholism and a recent break-up with Rakel, mother of a boy named Oleg whom Harry loves. After receiving a mysterious letter signed with a childlike drawing of a snowman, Harry meets new recruit Katrine Bratt and accompanies her investigation into the disappearance of Birte Becker, a woman with a husband and daughter. The two find a snowman at Becker's home.
Harry realizes Bratt has taken police files without permission. He learns she's looking for a link between several missing persons cases and another case, from nine years before, that was investigated by an alcoholic inspector named Gert Rafto. Katrine convinces Harry to join a new investigation into the disappearance of Sylvia Otterson, who they find alive and well at her farm. Shortly after they leave, a masked figured beheads Sylvia with an electrified cable harness. A call comes in requesting Harry specifically so he and Katrine return to the farmhouse. There they meet Sylvia's identical twin, Ane. Sylvia's body is inside her barn and her head atop a snowman.
Katrine believes corrupt businessman Arve Støp is responsible for the deaths. Traveling to Bergen to investigate further, Harry runs into Rakel's new boyfriend Mathias, a cosmetic surgeon, and realizes he forgot he had promised to take Oleg on a camping trip the same day. In Bergen, Harry finds that Inspector Rafto died by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Harry then discovers Katrine is Rafto's daughter.
It's discovered that the recent victims each visited the clinic of Dr. Vetlesen, who also oversees Støp's high-class prostitution ring. When Becker's phone is reactivated, the signal is traced to Vetlesen's house. Katrine goes to arrest Vetlesen herself but finds him dead of a gunshot wound to the head, along with the remains of Birte Becker and another missing person, Hegen Dahl. The police rule Vetlesen's death a suicide and suspend Katrine for breaking protocol.
Katrine, hoping to trick Støp into confessing to killing her father, flirts with him at a public event. He invites her to his hotel room where she sets up a hidden camera but to no avail; she is attacked and drugged by a masked figure who severs a finger on her right hand. The attacker uses the finger to unlock her work tablet and wipe all its data. The next morning, Harry finds Katrine dead inside a car decorated by the outline of a snowman on its roof.
Rakel visits Harry, admitting she is conflicted and misses him. They start kissing passionately but are interrupted by a phone call. The next day, Harry remembers Mathias worked at Vetlesen's clinic and realizes he is the killer. Meanwhile, Mathias kidnaps Rakel and Oleg, taking them to a cottage in Telemark. Harry locates the cottage and finds Mathias holding the mother and child hostage. Mathias is revealed to be the boy from the first scene, hating his mother for abandoning him and eventually targeting mothers whom he judges are harming their children. Harry frees Rakel from a cable harness but loses a finger. Mathias escapes and Harry chases him onto a frozen lake. Mathias shoots Harry then walks towards him. The ice beneath him breaks apart and he falls into the water, dragged beneath the ice by the current.
The final scene shows Harry, having had his finger surgically repaired, volunteering for a new homicide case.

Section: Production problems (2):
In response to the negative critical reviews, Alfredson blamed the heavily-condensed pre-production and rushed filming schedule, in which 10% to 15% of the screenplay remained unfilmed. This led to narrative problems when editing commenced:

Our shoot time in Norway was way too short, we didn't get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing. It's like when you're making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don't see the whole picture.
Alfredson also stated that he had a lack of time to prepare the film properly:

It happened very abruptly, suddenly we got notice that we had the money and could start the shoot in London.
Actor Val Kilmer suffered from an enlarged tongue during filming due to recent treatment for throat cancer. As such, many of his scenes were filmed without the actor visibly speaking as so to allow easier dubbing during post-production. To that end, all of Kilmer's dialogue is dubbed.

","An international cast and crew contributed to this mystery thriller, two hours of uninterrupted, snow-caked boredom in which a Norwegian detective (Michael Fassbender) tracks a serial killer who likes to chop up his female victims with a motor-driven, wire-looped amputation tool. Director Tomas Alfredson, best known for the Swedish vampire classic Let the Right One In (2008), works in drab, desaturated colors that heighten the sense of chill in his cheap, blocky, institutional settings. The actors come from all over the place (Fassbender from Ireland, Charlotte Gainsbourg from France, Rebecca Ferguson from Sweden, Toby Jones from the UK, J.K. Simmons from the U.S.) but play Norwegian characters speaking British-accented English, which is more perplexing than the string of murders. Martin Scorsese was attached as director at one point, and his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker helped pull this thing together. ",5.1,59100," Crime, Drama, Thriller ",Positive,0.733

Lee Ermey. Its plot follows a group of young adults traveling through rural Texas who encounter Leatherface and his murderous family. It is a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 film of the same name, and the fifth installment in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. Several crew members of the original film were involved with the project: Hooper and writer Kim Henkel served as co-producers, Daniel Pearl returned as cinematographer, and John Larroquette reprised his voice narration for the opening intertitles.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the first film to be produced by Platinum Dunes, who would go on to produce remakes of several other 20th-century horror films.","Section: Plot (1):
On August 18, 1973, five young adults – Erin, her boyfriend Kemper, and their friends Morgan, Andy, and Pepper – are on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert after traveling to Mexico to purchase marijuana. While driving through Texas, the group picks up a distraught and severely traumatised hitchhiker they see walking in the middle of the road. After they try to talk with the hitchhiker, who speaks incoherently about ""a bad man,"" she pulls a loaded revolver from between her legs and shoots herself in the mouth.
The group goes to a nearby diner to contact the police, where a woman named Luda Mae tells them to meet Sheriff Hoyt at the mill. Instead, they find a young boy named Jedidiah, who tells them Hoyt is at home, getting drunk. Erin and Kemper go through the woods to find his house, leaving Morgan, Andy, and Pepper at the mill with Jedidiah. They come across a plantation house, and Erin is allowed inside by an amputee named Monty to call for help. Kemper goes inside to look for Erin, and is killed with a sledgehammer by Thomas Hewitt, also known as ""Leatherface"", who drags his body into the basement to make a new mask.
Meanwhile, Hoyt arrives at the mill, and disposes of the hitchhiker's body. After Erin discovers that Kemper is missing, she and Andy go back to Monty's house, and Erin distracts him, while Andy searches for Kemper. When Monty realizes that Andy is inside, he summons Leatherface, who attacks him with a chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface severs Andy's leg, and carries him to the basement, where he is impaled on a meat hook. Erin makes it back to the mill, but before she and the others can leave, Hoyt shows up. After finding marijuana on the dashboard, he orders Erin and Pepper to get out of the van, gives Morgan the gun he took from the hitchhiker, and tells him to reenact how she killed herself. Morgan, disturbed by his demands, attempts to shoot him, but the gun is unloaded. Hoyt then handcuffs Morgan and drives him back to the Hewitt house, taking the van's key with him.
Erin and Pepper are tracked down by Leatherface, who is wearing Kemper's face as a mask, and when Pepper attempts to run, she is killed by Leatherface. Erin runs and hides in a nearby trailer, belonging to an obese middle-aged woman known only as the Tea Lady, and a younger woman named Henrietta, who gives her tea that has been drugged. Erin discovers that they have kidnapped the hitchhiker's baby, but passes out before she can escape. Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house, surrounded by the entire family: Leatherface, his mother Luda Mae, Hoyt, Monty, and Jedidiah. Luda Mae explains to Erin that Leatherface was tormented his whole life, because of a skin disease that left his face disfigured, and she felt that no one cared for her family besides themselves.
Erin is taken to the basement, where she finds Andy, and kills him to end his suffering. Afterwards, she finds Morgan handcuffed in a bathtub. Jedidiah, who does not agree with his family's actions, leads them out of the house, and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned shack in the woods, and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, who hangs him from a chandelier by his handcuffs, and cuts through his groin with the chainsaw. Erin escapes into the woods with Leatherface in tow. She finds a slaughterhouse and attacks Leatherface with a meat cleaver, severing his right arm.
Erin runs outside and flags down a trucker, whom she tries to convince to drive away from the Hewitt house, but he stops to find help at the eatery. Luda Mae and Hoyt talk to the trucker while Henrietta watches the baby. But when Henrietta goes outside to join in their conversation, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery, and places her in the sheriff's car. Erin hot-wires the car and Hoyt tries to stop her, but she runs him over repeatedly until he is dead. Leatherface suddenly appears in the road and slashes the car with his chainsaw, but Erin manages to escape with the baby, and he watches in frustration as she drives away. Two days later, two investigating officers are killed by Leatherface while doing a crime scene investigation of the Hewitt house, and a narrator states that the case still remains open.

On December 5, 2001, Creature Corner.com reported that Michael Bay's newly created company Platinum Dunes (which was created in order to produce low-budget films), had set its focus on remaking The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Early announcements on the site indicated that the story would be told in flashback with actress Marilyn Burns, who starred in the original film, reprising her role as an aged Sally Hardesty recounting the events in the film. It was later announced that the filmmakers had already purchased the rights to the original film.
Early in the film's production the original filmmakers Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel would be writing a script for the film, but it was unknown at the time whether or not their script would be used. In June 2002, it was announced that Marcus Nispel would direct the film in his directorial debut.  Nispel said that he was initially against the idea of remaking the film, calling it ""blasphemy"" to his longtime director of photography, Daniel Pearl, who had shot the original film.  Pearl, however, encouraged Nispel to join the project, as he wanted to bookend his career with Chainsaw films.It was later announced that Scott Kosar signed on as the film's screenwriter.
As in the original 1974 version, it is loosely inspired by the real-life crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. Gein's crimes had also inspired novels such as Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs, both of which were later adapted into subsequent films.

Section: Writing (2):
The screenplay was written by Scott Kosar, who went on to write the screenplays for The Machinist and Platinum Dunes remake of The Amityville Horror.
The film was Kosar's first professional job as a screenwriter and later recalled feeling both thrilled and honored at the prospect of writing the screenplay for the remake. Kosar also realized early on that he was dealing with ""one of the seminal works of the genre"" and one that could not be bettered. When discussing with the film's producers, Kosar felt that the new film shouldn't try to compete with the original film, as he felt that it was made under different circumstances.
In earlier drafts Erin, the film's main character, was revealed to be nine months pregnant throughout the film but was removed from later drafts at producer Michael Bay's insistence.

Jessica Biel, who previously starred in the television series 7th Heaven, was cast as the main character Erin.Actor Andrew Bryniarski, who starred in Bay's Pearl Harbor and stayed friends with him afterwards, personally met with producer Bay and asked him for the role of Leatherface. Another actor, named Brett Wagner, was cast for the role before Bryniarski, but, on the first day, the actor was hospitalized and fired for lying about his physical abilities. Without an actor for the film's main antagonist, the filmmakers called and asked if Bryniarski still wanted the role, which he accepted. To prepare for the role, Bryniarski ate a diet of brisket and white bread in order to get his weight to nearly 300 pounds. Bryniarski would later reprise his role as Leatherface in the film's prequel.

Section: Filming (2):
Nispel favored shooting the film in California, but Bay suggested Texas, where he had previously shot three times. Principal photography began in Austin in July 2002 and lasted 40 days. Nispel intentionally shot the film in a different style, using more traditionally narrative elements, as he did not want to make a shot-for-shot remake replicating the original film's documentary-like style. Cinematographer Pearl explained from an on-set interview: ""People ask me, 'Is it going to be as gritty and grainy as the last one I did?' No. I did that. There's no point in making the exact same film with the exact same look.""The remake includes references to the previous film, including John Larroquette, who returns in his role as the film's narrator.The weather during filming was very hot and humid. Bryniarski, who portrays Leatherface in the film, did all his own stunts and was forced to wear a ""fat suit"", which increased his near-300 lbs to 420 lbs. The suit also heated up quickly, so the actor had to ensure that he drank a lot of fluids before a shoot. Leatherface's mask was also a problem; the mask was made out of silicone and was difficult for the actor to breathe through. The crew had many prop chainsaws for actor Bryniarski to use, such as chainsaws that put out smoke, and live chainsaws.

Bahrani was roped in to helm the adaptation, and was eager to do so, having read early drafts of the novel even before it was published.

In 2010, entrepreneur Balram Halwai emails Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, requesting a meeting, and relating his life story. He states his belief that the Indian underclass is trapped in a perpetual state of servitude, like chickens in a chicken coop.
As a young boy in Laxmangarh, Balram is offered a scholarship to a school in Delhi because of his advanced academics. He is told that he is a ""white tiger,"" someone born only once in a century. However when his father is unable to pay off village landlord 'the Stork', Balram is forced by his grandmother to work in the village's tea stall, and he never returns to school. Balram's father dies from tuberculosis, with no doctor to treat him.
As a young man, Balram aspires to become a chauffeur for the Stork's son Ashok, who has returned from the United States with his Jackson Heights-raised wife Pinky. Balram has his grandmother sponsor his driving lessons, with the promise of sharing his chauffeur salary. Balram is hired as the Stork family's second driver, but is also given menial tasks to complete and is otherwise mistreated. Balram is kept loyal by the threat of him and his entire family being murdered if he were to conduct a betrayal.
Ashok and Pinky make plans to move to Delhi, where Ashok will bribe Indian politicians so that his family would avoid paying tax money. Balram, wanting to drive for them in Delhi, exposes the secret of the family's primary driver: he is a Muslim. After the primary driver is fired (due to the family's stereotypical prejudice against Muslims), Balram joins the couple in Delhi. In contrast to other members of their family, Ashok and Pinky generally treat Balram with respect and eventually become closer to him, though they still view him as a servant.
In Delhi, on Pinky's birthday, she and Ashok get drunk and force Balram to let Pinky drive, which results in her accidentally hitting and killing a child. The Stork family coerces Balram into signing a confession endorsed by his grandmother. Ultimately, no one is charged, but Balram is left shaken, and in no doubt that he is completely disposable to the Stork family.
Pinky leaves Ashok to return to New York, leaving Balram to emotionally support him. Balram realizes that loyal service to Ashok was no guarantee of a comfortable life once his services were no longer needed. Balram begins to defraud Ashok with fake invoices, while making money on the side by selling the car's petrol and using the car as an unlicensed taxi.
Balram encounters a series of setbacks. He angers the Stork family when he donates change to a beggar. Balram's grandmother unexpectedly sends one of his younger nephews to live with him in order to learn how to become a driver. Balram also learns that his grandmother is following through with her plans to get him married against his wishes. Meanwhile, Ashok prepares to pay a particularly large bribe, while also arranging to imminently replace Balram with a new driver.
Balram has an epiphany on how to escape servitude as the ""white tiger"". To obtain the bribe money, Balram murders Ashok. Balram flees the city with his nephew and the money. An arrest warrant is put out for Balram but he evades capture.
Balram takes his nephew with him to Bangalore, then a bubble for large IT companies. He uses a portion of the stolen cash to bribe the police to eliminate taxi service providers for a lack of licenses. Balram starts his own taxi company, thus becoming wealthy himself. He treats his drivers as employees and not as servants. He takes personal and financial responsibility for any incidents caused by them, even employing a sibling of a child killed in an accident caused by a company driver. He sponsors his nephew's education, while acknowledging that his remaining family back home may have been killed by the Stork's men in retribution.
Happy to escape servitude, Balram reveals at the end of the film that he changed his name to Ashok Sharma.

However, as there was no directors Deora picked, he chose his college-friend and director Ramin Bahrani to helm the film. Eventually Bahrani, read the rough drafts of the novel years before it was published, with Deora stating ""He's very dedicated to adapt it into a film"". Bahrani added ""It’s an epic story that required a lot of financing and money and resources to get it made in India, that wasn’t so easy when the novel came out"". He initially sold the distribution rights to Netflix, as Bahrani stated that ""it had an appetite for global stories, for voices that are not typically represented behind a camera or in front of the camera"".When Priyanka Chopra scrolled through Twitter, she saw a headline that a film adaptation of the novel was in the works. She called her agent about the film to offer her collaboration. Thus, Chopra served as one of the executive producers of the film, under her banner Purple Pebble Pictures, alongside Prem Akkaraju, Ava DuVernay and Ken Kamins.
(The book) had a profound effect on me. It made me uncomfortable and made me think about a part of the world that we sort of desensitize ourselves to. When I read the book, I was fascinated with the perspective of the narrative. The story's portrayal of raw ambition and the extent one will go to achieve one's goals is riveting.

While Bahrani added and deleted a few sequences and adapted the character for the screen, the story stays largely faithful to the novel. He stated: ""The hardest part was cutting things out, since I love the book so much. But when I put all of it in the script, it came to 200 pages! Aravind gave me a wealth of gold and cutting it is just not easy.” Initially, he considered updating the story (set in 2005) to a more recent setting, before abandoning the idea, as it is a period film.  In the making of the script Baharani stated ""One of the biggest changes today is that thing in your hand, the supercomputer. In today’s world, Balram wouldn’t be writing emails, he’d probably be doing video or Instagram. This is only the second time in my life that I’ve adapted a book and I wanted to stick to it.""

Bahrani turned down some established stars for the part of Balram: “I had an opportunity to talk with a lot of actors, stars that you might know, Bollywood stars who are all incredible. But at a certain point, while I was in India, I felt that the lead actor should be from India and preferably unknown. I just felt it matched the character and the story of an underdog."" Rajkummar Rao was also roped in to play a prominent role in the film, along with Priyanka Chopra, despite serving as the co-producer. Before filming, Bahrani spent months in India, riding local buses, visiting the places Adiga had written about, and meeting scores of people, before eventually meeting Adarsh Gourav. Gourav prepared for his role by living anonymously in a remote village in Jharkhand and working for 12 hours a day, washing plates.
I didn’t want to see a rich successful actor playing the part of that underclass underdog who’s going to do something crazy in the film. And Adarsh (Gourav) just blew me away in the audition… He has this great winning smile, he’s very charming and you like him immediately. But if you don’t pay attention and you look at him again he’s got a laser on you and you don’t know what he might do – and I needed that duality.

The Times's Kevin Maher rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, noting the film as ""a dizzy, woozy, taxi ride to the dark side"" and praised Chopra Jonas' performance, calling her ""impressive"".Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair praised the acting and Bahrani's direction and screenplay, saying that the film brings the celebrated novel to vivid life. In his  4 out of 5 stars review, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph wrote ""a punchy, propulsive watch, blown along by snappy editing and a hip-hop-driven soundtrack that stresses that there’s still much fun to be had when hefty themes of inequality and geopolitics are being tackled."" Bilge Ebiri of the New York magazine called the film ""a Brutal, Powerful Tale of Ambition, Class, and Corruption"" that ""cuts across borders and continents, and [...] cuts into the soul as well"". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 4 stars out of 5, describing as a ""Balzac-worthy satire of submission and power"" and wrote ""Bahrani [adapts and] also directs with terrific storytelling energy."" Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent opined that the film was a ""dark but exhilarating satire of capitalism"". Peter Travers of ABC News praised the ""throughout pitch perfect"" acting and Bahrani's direction, writing ""Ramin Bahrani keeps you on the edge of your seat.""Owen Gleiberman of Variety opined that the film is ""an ironic study of the psychology of servitude"", praising the performances by Chopra Jonas' and Gourav whom he called ""marvelous"".David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a ""B"", calling it a ""darkly comic thriller"" and a ""brutal corrective"" to Slumdog Millionaire (2008). K. Austin Collins from Rolling Stone gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing that the film was a capable, compelling and topical drama but suffered ""for giving us a setup that’s richer than the follow-through."" The critic praised Gourav's performances as ""unassuming but pitch-perfect"" and he felt that Rao and Chopra Jonas also gave equally worthy performances. In a mixed review,  A.O. Scott of The New York Times deemed the film ""a barbed rags-to-riches tale"" and wrote ""The plot is lively, and the settings vividly captured by Bahrani and the director of photography, Paolo Carnera, but the characters don’t quite come to life. They aren’t trapped by prescribed social roles so much as by the programmatic design of the narrative, which insists it is showing things as they really are. If it wasn’t so insistent, it might be more convincing."" Jesse Hassenger of The A. V. Club criticised the film for only ""hitting the key themes and scenes without finding an independent tone"", while also adding that the overtly explaining narration repeatedly takes the reins away from Gourav’s acting.

128,Tiramisu,Italy,Colorado Film Production,Medusa Film ,,,91,,,,,,,,"Antonio is a medical equipment representative who struggles to place his products, consuming himself in long waits in the waiting rooms of general practitioners and in the corridors of hospitals. He is married to Aurora, a beautiful teacher with a gift for cooking: her tiramisu is unbeatable. When her brother-in-law Franco, a successful fashion manager and cynical observer of human nature, insinuates that the relationship between her sister and her husband will not last forever because she will sooner or later realize that she has married a good-for-nothing (for arrived afflicted by lazy spermatozoa), Antonio decides to adopt Franco's disenchanted vision and to throw away all ethics and moral codes, using his wife's tiramisu as an effective business card for his customers.
Fabio De Luigi makes his directorial debut with this comedy written and interpreted by himself, produced by Maurizio Totti and populated by many well-known faces of the Colorado team. Unfortunately, however, De Luigi, as a line in the film says, has seen (and done) too much television, and this story of frustrations and redemptions remains solidly anchored to the language, settings and characters of the small screen. The plot is full of implausibility, right from the very first scenes (for example the one in which, inside a movie theater, Aurora explains in detail the recipe for her tiramisu); the characters don't seem to have any relevance to reality, neither in emotions nor in reactions; Aurora and Franco reveal inexplicably (were it not for the regional origin of the two interpreters) one a slight Tuscan accent, the other a heavy Sicilian accent; Antonio, although not ignorant, has never heard of the painter Andrea Mantegna (whom he defines as ""a minor foreigner""); the scenes take place in an imaginary geography that brings together Rome and (probably) the Friuli which partly financed the film. The characterizations, apart from that of the ubiquitous De Luigi, are barely sketched, from the hateful brother-in-law to the hyperpatient and amused wife by all the husband's jokes to the nostalgic friend Marco who is unable to make a wine shop called Vini e vinili work - great marketing idea these days - which instead will take off after being transformed into an obsolete disco bar populated by snatchers.
Any episode of Love Bugs was funnier and even more believable than Tiramisu, and that's a shame, because De Luigi was an original comedian at Gialappa's court and an interesting performer on Gabriele Salvatores and Alessandro Genovesi's team. But his true individual author identity has yet to come out. ",5.2,641, Comedy ,Negative,0.664

Shy high school junior Lara Jean Covey writes letters to boys she feels an intense passion for before locking them away in her closet. Her most recent is to her childhood friend Josh, who was dating her older sister Margot until she moves to college, and breaks up with him. Lara Jean has always had a crush on Josh but decides it would not be okay to date him. One night, Lara Jean falls asleep on the couch while hanging out with her little sister, Kitty, who sneaks into her room and finds her collection of letters. The following Monday at school, Lara Jean is confronted by a former crush, Peter Kavinsky. He received the letter she had written him, causing her to faint. After waking up, she sees Josh approaching with his letter, and in a moment of panic, Lara Jean kisses Peter to throw Josh off before running away
Lara Jean then encounters another recipient of a letter, Lucas, who is gay, as she begins to realize that all the letters have been mailed out. She later left her house to avoid both Josh and Peter, but the latter appears at her favorite diner. She explains that the kiss was merely to dissuade Josh. Peter is surprisingly okay with this, and proposes that he and Lara Jean fake date to make his ex-girlfriend (Lara Jean's ex-best friend and nemesis) Gen jealous. She agrees, and the next few months go by with the whole school, along with their respective friends and families, believing they are dating.
When Peter finds that Gen is actually jealous, he is himself conflicted. At the same time, Lara Jean finds herself jealous. On the school ski trip, Lara Jean and Peter confront each other about their true feelings, ending up kissing while alone in a hot tub. At the end of the trip, Gen tells Lara Jean that Peter spent the night in her room after the kiss, taunting Lara Jean with her scrunchie Peter let her take, Lara Jean's favorite. Furious, she breaks up with Peter and storms home, where she finds Margot has returned from college. Peter then comes, hoping to explain that nothing happened between him and Gen, but Josh arrives as well. Margot overhears everything, and is upset when she learns of Lara Jean's former feelings for Josh. Things are worsened when, after Lara Jean asks Peter to leave, she sees that a seemingly pornographic video of her and Peter in the hot tub has been put up on Instagram.
Lara Jean asks Margot for help, who calms and comforts her. Kitty then reveals she sent the letters. Lara Jean is enraged, Margot calms her down, and makes her realize she may have wanted to send them but was too afraid to, and the sisters forgive each other before getting Instagram to take down the video. After Christmas break, Lara Jean discovers that everyone at school knows about the video. Peter tells everyone that nothing happened. When Lara Jean confronts Gen about it, she admits she tried to sabotage their relationship as she felt betrayed that Lara Jean kissed Peter during spin the bottle four years ago. Talking with her dad, she reevaluates her relationships, becoming friends with Josh again. When she hesitates to tell Peter about her real feelings, Kitty shows her notes that he wrote during their 'relationship'. Lara Jean goes to see Peter, and he tells her that he is in love with her. They kiss before walking off together.
In a mid-credits scene, John Ambrose McClaren, one of the five recipients of Lara Jean's letters, arrives at her door with flowers in hand.

Han added, ""For [To All the Boys I've Loved Before], all I can say is this is the story that I wrote.""A scene in the film featured Kitty offering Peter a bottle of Yakult led to a spike in sales for the drink in parts of the world.

Lara Jean Covey, accompanied by her sisters Kitty and Margot, her father Dan, and her neighbor Trina Rothschild, visits Seoul for spring break. She reconnects with the memory of her mother by searching for a lock her mother had left on a bridge to memorialize her love for Dan, and finally manages to read her accompanying message, which says ""for the rest of my life."" Returning home, she mentions to her boyfriend, Peter Kavinsky, that the two of them never had a meet-cute, meeting Peter's disbelief because he remembers their first meeting quite well. She nervously waits for the result of her Stanford University application so she can attend college with Peter. As Dan's relationship with Trina becomes more serious and the family begins to plan their upcoming wedding, Lara Jean is disappointed when she is accepted to her safety schools, the University of California, Berkeley and New York University, but is rejected from Stanford.
Initially leaning towards Berkeley to live closer to Peter, Lara Jean enjoys New York City during a school trip and decides on NYU. She explains her decision to Peter, but his disappointment at her decision is palpable, and he decides to break up with her on prom night to save himself what he sees as the inevitable breakdown of a long-distance relationship. Respecting Lara Jean's wishes, Peter skips Dan and Trina's wedding; he also meets with his formerly absentee father for a meal and chooses to try and reconnect despite the years of his absence. After the wedding festivities, Kitty conspires with Peter to set up a meeting between him and Lara Jean under the wedding tent. Lara Jean finds a letter in her yearbook from Peter containing his account of their first meeting in sixth grade and a proposed contract to always love each other despite the 3,000 miles (4,800 km) between Stanford and NYU. Peter walks in and asks her to sign on, to which she joyfully assents. The film ends with Lara Jean's reflection on wanting what she has with Peter, regardless of what films say and what stereotypes say about long-distance relationships. She remains optimistic that the distance will offer them the opportunity to keep writing love letters to one another.

Lara Jean Covey's high school sets up a volunteer program; while her boyfriend Peter Kavinsky volunteers with his friends, Lara Jean goes to Belleview Retirement Home instead,  where her older sister Margot went. 
On her first day there, she meets Stormy, an eccentric old lady who Margot often mentioned and discovers that John Ambrose McClaren is also volunteering at Belleview. They talk about a love letter she had written to him many years ago, and he lets her read the letter as long as she gives it back to him afterward. Lara Jean is unable to stop thinking about their conversation and, in addition, is constantly insecure about her relationship with Peter because she can't stop comparing herself with her ex-best friend, and Peter's ex-girlfriend, Gen.
On Valentine's Day, Lara Jean witnesses her classmates being serenaded by special acapella groups and is told by a friend that Peter had sent a group to serenade Gen every period, back when they were still dating. This enhances her insecurity, though she forgets about this when she meets with Peter later that day. He gives her a silver heart necklace and reads a poem, which she believes is original but turns out to be two verses of an Edgar Allan Poe poem. He later apologizes and tells her he wishes he could write something like that for her, though he means everything in the poem.
While volunteering at Belleview, Lara Jean and John Ambrose grow closer and throw a Star Ball for Belleview after discovering some old decorations; He appears to be developing feelings for her, who hasn't told him about her relationship with Peter. Instead, they arrange to go to their old middle school hangout spot, a treehouse, to dig up the time capsule they buried years ago with their friends, including Gen, and take turns unpacking it. Gen claims that she didn't put any in the time capsule,  Peter gets jealous of John Ambrose and reveals his relationship with Lara Jean. She and Peter argue but end up making up.
The next day, Lara Jean apologizes to John Ambrose for not telling him about Peter, and then dresses up for Peter's game. As she is waiting for Peter to come out, Chris shows her a photo of Gen and him. She confronts Peter and realizes that Peter never stopped talking to Gen and, on the ski trip, Peter was planning to get back together with Gen that night. As Peter is in a rush to get to the game, he tells Lara Jean they will have to talk about it later, but she's too hurt and breaks up with him. She goes to the treehouse later and meets Gen, who reveals that Peter was only comforting her as her parents are separating. She went to Peter because he had undergone the same experience, that Peter is crazy about Lara Jean, and that she shouldn't doubt him. She also reveals that she had, in fact, put a friendship bracelet identical to Lara Jean's in the capsule, and was too embarrassed to show it. Lara Jean realizes that it was her and not Peter who always had Gen on her mind, and makes up with Gen.
On the night of the retirees' ball, Stormy gives Lara Jean a dress and a makeover. She and John Ambrose dance before going outside in the snow. When they kiss, Lara Jean realizes that she truly loves Peter and doesn't hold feelings for John. She apologizes to him and rushes outside, surprised to find Peter waiting outside for her. He is waiting outside because he remembers she doesn't like driving in the snow, a fact that she told him on their first date. He says that she can break his heart if she wants, but she says that she loves him instead, and he tells her he loves her back. They kiss and make up, and in an ending voiceover Lara Jean says that she had wanted a fairytale relationship with Peter, but is now satisfied with what she has.

There's so many things in the second book that I would love to see in a sequel.

132,To Live,Italy,Lotus Production ,01 Distribution,,Francesca Archibugi,103,Francesca Archibugi,2332728,,"Vivere è un film del 2019 diretto da Francesca Archibugi.
",,,," In my essay on Jia Zhang-ke’s Ash Is Purest White that appears in the current issue of the Reader, I asserted that ""one of the more compelling things about the film [which takes place over 17 years] is how you can never predict when Jia will flash forward in time. It's one of those movies . . . in which time exists as an autonomous force."" Writing that line made me think about other movies that cover long stretches of time in such an idiosyncratic fashion, movies that subvert the conventions cemented by too many routine biopics.

Lesser films have trained viewers to expect certain things from narratives that follow characters over multiple decades. Characters decide on their ambitions for life as children or young adults (as if we're supposed to know what we want out of life by that time), and spend the rest of their adulthoods achieving or longing to realize those ambitions. Sundry ""little"" observations in the first half will return, and with greater weight, in the second (as if our lives ran on smooth, cyclical paths). Relationships will exist mainly to teach the protagonist something about living. These conventions add to the illusion that time is a sturdy, dependable thing that moves us progressively toward self-actualization. Below are capsule reviews from the Reader archives of movies that subvert that illusion either subtly (by rendering time's passing poetically rather than prosaically) or radically (with jarring edits or sudden transitions).

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp It's almost impossible to define this 1943 masterpiece by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It was ostensibly based on a cartoon series that satirized the British military class, yet its attitude toward the main character is one of affection, respect, and sometimes awe; it was intended as a propaganda film, yet Churchill wanted to suppress it; it has the romantic sweep of a grand love story, yet none of the romantic relationships it presents is truly fulfilled, and the film's most lasting bond is one between the British colonel (Roger Livesey) and his Prussian counterpart (Anton Walbrook). Pressburger's screenplay covers 40 years in the colonel's life through a series of brilliantly constructed flashbacks, compressions, and ellipses; Powell's camera renders the winding plot through boldly deployed Technicolor hues and camera movements of exquisite design and expressivity. It stands as very possibly the finest film ever made in Britain. With Deborah Kerr, Roland Culver, and James McKechnie. —Dave Kehr  The Long Gray Line John Ford's first film in 'Scope also happens to be one of his major neglected works of the 50s—a biopic of epic proportions (138 minutes) about West Point athletic instructor Marty Maher (Tyrone Power), who was a mess-hall waiter before joining the army but returned to West Point to become a much-beloved teacher—an example of the sort of “victory in defeat” or at least equivocal heroism that comprises much of Ford's oeuvre. Adapted by Edward Hope from Maher's autobiography, Bringing Up the Brass: My 55 Years at West Point, the film is rich with nostalgia, family feeling, and sentimentality. It's given density by a superb supporting cast (including Maureen O'Hara at her most luminous, Donald Crisp, Ward Bond, and Harry Carey Jr.) and a kind of mysticism that, as in How Green Was My Valley, makes the past seem even more alive than the present. Clearly not for every taste, but a work that vibrates with tenderness and emotion (1955). —Jonathan Rosenbaum Great moments stud Bernardo Bertolucci's 1976 Marxist epic, but the end result is ambiguous. Robert De Niro is a landowner, Gerard Dépardieu is a peasant; they share a birthday and most of the history of the 20th century—the fall of feudalism, the rise of fascism, and two world wars. In the film's four-hour version, at least, the characterizations are hazy and the narrative seems jerky. Some scenes are banal and offensively simpleminded. But patience, ultimately, is rewarded with a welter of detail and some mighty fine camerawork. With Donald Sutherland, Burt Lancaster, Dominique Sanda, Stefania Sandrelli, and Sterling Hayden.

133,V for Vendetta,United Kingdom,Silver Pictures ,Warner Bros. Pictures,Natalie Portman Hugo Weaving Stephen Rea Stephen Fry John Hurt,The Wachowskis[b],132,James McTeigue,54000000,132511035,"V for Vendetta is a 2005 dystopian political action film directed by James McTeigue and written by the Wachowskis, based on the 1988 DC limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. The film is set in an alternative future where a Nordic supremacist and neo-fascist totalitarian regime has subjugated the United Kingdom. It centres on V (portrayed by Hugo Weaving), an anarchist and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, and Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission. Stephen Rea portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.
Produced by Silver Pictures, Virtual Studios and Anarchos Productions Inc., V for Vendetta was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on 4 November 2005 (a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on 17 March 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, From Hell (2001) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), declined to watch the film and asked to not be credited or paid royalties.
V for Vendetta has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: ""The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny – and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.""","Section: Plot (1):
The world is in turmoil, with the United States fractured as a result of a second civil war and a pandemic of the ""St. Mary's Virus"" ravaging Europe. The United Kingdom is ruled as a Nordic supremacist and neo-fascist police state by the Norsefire Party, helmed by all-powerful High Chancellor Adam Sutler. Political opponents, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, atheists, homosexuals, and other ""undesirables"" are imprisoned and executed.
On November 4, a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask, ""V,"" rescues Evey Hammond, an employee of state-run British Television Network, from members of the ""Fingermen"" secret police. After the stroke of midnight, they watch his demolition of the Old Bailey, accompanied by fireworks and the ""1812 Overture"". Inspector Finch of Scotland Yard investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rebel against their government and meet him on next year's Guy Fawkes Night outside the Houses of Parliament. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape but is knocked unconscious.
V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the Bishop of London. Evey offers to help but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and others at Larkhill concentration camp twenty years earlier; seeing her genuine remorse, he kills her painlessly.
After Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided, and Evey is captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being a lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V staged her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was indeed real, secretly passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned at Larkhill. Initially enraged, Evey realizes she has become stronger. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.
Reading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a bioweapons program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, Secretary of Defence at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill, which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a tube station and a water treatment plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people and was blamed on a terrorist organisation. Norsefire used the fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor, win an overwhelming majority in Parliament, and profit off the cure for the virus. Although Finch later disbelieves the story after discovering Rookwood is V in disguise, his faith in the Norsefire government is shaken.
As November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks. Riots begin to break out as the United Kingdom slowly descends into anarchy. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with ANFO explosives in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded from the hail of gunfire during the battle, V staggers to the tunnel where Evey is waiting and finally admits he loves her before dying in her arms. Despite their earlier experiences, Evey has grown close to V and is visibly heartbroken by his death.
Finch finds Evey placing V's body aboard the train. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. Without any orders, the military allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, ""He was all of us.""

The film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in The Matrix series. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore's works: V for Vendetta and Watchmen. After the release and relative success of Road House, writer Hilary Henkin was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity. The Wachowskis were fans of V for Vendetta and in the mid-1990s, before working on The Matrix, wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third The Matrix films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to James McTeigue. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and found them to be relevant to the contemporary political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story, while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes. James McTeigue cites the film The Battle of Algiers as his principal influence in preparing to film V for Vendetta.Moore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing, as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work. He ended cooperation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, Warner Bros., failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes (fascism and anarchism) against one another. He argues his work had been recast as a story about ""current American neoconservatism vs. current American liberalism"". Per his wishes, Moore's name does not appear in the film's closing credits. Co-creator and illustrator David Lloyd supports the film adaptation, commenting that the script is very good but that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book-to-screen adaptation.

James Purefoy was originally cast as V, but dropped out after six weeks into filming. Although at the time it was reported this was because of difficulties wearing the mask for the entire film, he later stated this was not the case. He was replaced by Hugo Weaving, who had previously worked with Joel Silver and the Wachowskis on The Matrix series.
Director James McTeigue first met Natalie Portman during the filming of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, on which he worked as assistant director. In preparation for the role, Portman worked with dialect coach Barbara Berkery to speak in a British accent, studied films such as The Weather Underground, and read the autobiography of Menachem Begin. She received top billing for the film. Her role in the film has parallels to her role in Léon: The Professional. According to Portman: ""the relationship between V and Evey has a complication [like] the relationship in that film."" She also had her head shaved on camera during a scene in which her character is tortured.

Section: Filming (2):
V for Vendetta was filmed in London, England, and in Potsdam, Germany, at Babelsberg Studios. Much of the film was shot on sound stages and indoor sets, with location work done in Berlin for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned London Underground were filmed at the disused Aldwych tube station. Filming began in early March 2005 and lasted through early June 2005. V for Vendetta is the final film shot by cinematographer Adrian Biddle, who died of a heart attack on 7 December 2005, 4 days prior to its world debut.To film the final scene at Westminster, the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and Big Ben had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5 am. This was the first time the security-sensitive area (home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence) had ever been closed to accommodate filming. Prime Minister (at the time of filming) Tony Blair's son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal, stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.

Section: Post-production (2):
The film was designed to have a retrofuturistic look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.
One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 73% approval rating based on 248 reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Visually stunning and thought-provoking, V For Vendetta's political pronouncements may rile some, but its story and impressive set pieces will nevertheless entertain."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.Ebert and Roeper gave the film a ""two thumbs up"" rating. Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta ""almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will"". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany.Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a ""woeful, depressing failure"" and stating that the ""cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue."" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticising the film's treatment of its political message as being ""fairly dim, adolescent stuff,"" as well as expressing dislike for the ""barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult."" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says ""it's not hard to see why,"" as well as criticising Portman's performance: ""Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.""Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film ""works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three"". He added that the film will become ""a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age."" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is ""a bit of a mess ... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.""V for Vendetta received few awards, although at the 2007 Saturn Awards Natalie Portman won the Best Actress award. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. V was included on Fandomania's list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters. Empire magazine named the film the 418th greatest movie of all time in 2008.

V for Vendetta deals with issues of totalitarianism, criticism of religion, homosexuality, Islamophobia and terrorism. Its controversial story line and themes have been the target of both criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups.
On 17 April 2006, the New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists organised a protest against DC Comics and Time Warner, accusing it of watering down the story's original message in favour of violence and special effects. David Graeber, an anarchist scholar and former professor at Yale University, was not upset by the film. ""I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood."" However, Graeber went on to state: ""Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making. That's what is absent from Hollywood's interpretation.""Film critic Richard Roeper dismissed right-wing Christian criticism of the film on the television show Ebert and Roeper, saying that V's ""terrorist"" label is applied in the film ""by someone who's essentially Hitler, a dictator.""LGBT commentators have praised the film for its positive depiction of gay people. Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com called the film ""one of the most pro-gay ever"". Warn went on to praise the central role of the character Valerie ""not just because it is beautifully acted and well-written, but because it is so utterly unexpected [in a Hollywood film].""David Walsh of the World Socialist Web Site criticised V's actions as ""antidemocratic,"" calling the film an example of ""the bankruptcy of anarcho-terrorist ideology;"" Walsh writes that because the people have not played any part in the revolution, they will be unable to produce a ""new, liberated society.""The film was broadcast on China's national TV station, China Central Television (CCTV) on 16 December 2012 completely uncensored, surprising many viewers. While many believed that the government had banned the film, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stated that it was not aware of a ban; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films. Liu Shanying, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship is getting loosened.

Missy Moreno is at home with her dad, Marcus, when they receive word that aliens are invading. Missy is taken to Heroics Headquarters and placed in a vault with other children of the Heroics, a team of superheroes. Marcus, retired as a superhero, is reinstated by Mrs. Granada, leader of the Program.
Missy meets the other children: Wheels, who possesses super-intelligence; Noodles, who can stretch his body; Ojo, who is mute and communicates through art; A-Capella, who can move objects by singing; Slo-Mo, who is always in slow motion; Face Maker, who can make any face; Rewind and Fast Forward, twins that can alter time; Wild Card, who has immense power but no control over it; and Guppy, who has ""shark strength"" and can shape water into anything.  
The kids watch the battle between the aliens and Heroics on television, which ends with the Heroics' capture. Missy realises that Ojo's drawings tell the future. When a drawing shows aliens breaking into the vault, the kids hatch a plan to escape. 
Face Maker tricks the guards into coming into the vault where Guppy subdues them, but not before one of the guards triggers an emergency lockdown. Rewind sends them back in time, Wheels stops the guard from pushing the button, and Noodles steals their security badges. Mrs. Granada spots Missy in the hallway and seals the doors, but A-Capella makes a staircase to the roof, allowing them to escape. Noodles secures a vehicle, and the kids escape.

Granada goes after Wild Card, but not before the protective shield around the motherboard is deactivated. With the kids holding off the aliens, Wheels and Noodles remove the motherboard and swap it with a new one deactivating the alien's rocket and foiling the takeover. To the kids' surprise, their parents emerge from the rocket. Ojo reveals that she and Ms. Granada faked the ""takeover"" to train the kids to be the new Heroics.

The film stars Richie Merritt, Matthew McConaughey, Bel Powley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Brian Tyree Henry, Rory Cochrane, RJ Cyler, Jonathan Majors, Eddie Marsan, Bruce Dern, and Piper Laurie. White Boy Rick is loosely based on the story of Richard Wershe Jr., who in the 1980s became the youngest FBI informant ever at the age of 14.
The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2018 and was released in the United States on September 14, 2018, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $25 million, $4 million short of its $29 million budget.","Section: Plot (1):
In 1984, Rick Wershe is a struggling single father living in Detroit during the height of the crack epidemic and war on drugs. His dissatisfied daughter, Dawn, leaves their home, leaving Rick alone with his son, Ricky. Rick manufactures gun parts and sells guns illegally to make ends meet, and involves his son in a sale of silenced AK-47s with local gangster Johnny Curry. Ricky becomes good friends with Johnny's brother, Boo, which earns him the favor of Johnny and his crew. News of Rick's activity attracts the attention of the FBI and he is questioned by two agents, Alex Snyder and Frank Byrd, who see Ricky as a potential asset due to his connections with the criminal underworld. They convince Ricky to become an undercover informant behind Rick's back in exchange for money and immunity for his father. Ricky is asked to sell drugs to keep up appearances, becoming captivated by his extravagant new lifestyle, and eventually gains enough credibility as a ""legitimate"" drug supplier. Rick is suspicious of his son and confronts Ricky when he finds thousands of dollars in illicit cash underneath his bed, causing a rift between them. While Ricky is meeting with Dawn at a diner one evening, his grandfather's car is stolen, and the two shoot at the fleeing car. They are arrested but bailed out by Ricky's handlers, which arouses suspicion from Johnny.
At a party following a boxing match in Las Vegas, Johnny beats his rival's friend, Black Ed, within an inch of his life with a bottle of champagne. Afterwards, he orders a drive-by on the home of his rival, Leon Lucas, killing one of his young nephews. Ricky learns that the weapons used were the same AK-47s he had sold to Johnny. Devastated by his involvement in the murder of a child, he keeps a low profile and mends his relationship with his father. Johnny suspects Ricky is an informant and sends Nug to his house, who shoots him in the stomach. While at the hospital, Snyder informs Ricky that they have enough evidence to raid all of Johnny's safe houses, and asks him to forget about the shooting in exchange for dropping all charges on his father.
A year later in 1986, Brenda Moore's brother tells Ricky that Brenda had a daughter named Keisha, and that Ricky is the father. Rick and Ricky come over to see the child, who wins over the affection of both of them. Later on, they find Dawn at a drug den and forcibly take her home to detox. She eventually makes a full recovery after several days.
In 1987, Ricky goes back to selling crack and assumes the role that Johnny left behind, even going so far as having sex with his wife, Cathy. Rick discovers he has earned more than enough money to make his father's dream of opening up a video store come true. FBI agents arrest Ricky and he is held on drug possession with intent to distribute which could land him a potential life sentence. Ricky's former handlers deny their relationship with him, but promise they will try to get his sentence reduced if he cooperates on one last bust. Ricky has Cathy help him out with a large shipment of drugs, the FBI raid the deal, and arrest everyone involved. Ricky is found guilty and is sentenced to life in prison. Rick confronts the two agents about their deal but they feign ignorance.
After another year, Dawn, Rick, and Keisha visit Ricky in prison. Rick tries to give his son hope but Ricky laments that his life is over. Rick tears up and apologizes for not being able to give him an easy life like he wanted. The credits reveal that Ricky was imprisoned for over 30 years, holding the record for the longest prison term for a non-violent offender in the state of Michigan. He was finally released on parole in 2017. His father passed away in 2014. His daughter, Keisha, is now happily married with two sons. A voice recording of the real Ricky Wershe Jr. plays in the background, saying that nobody thought he should really be in prison, but that he was feeling happy and hopeful.

Mr. Deacon, a school employee and father of six, overhears and shares with them that he maintains order in his house by having a 'yes day' from time to time: one 24-hour period wherein the parents cannot say no, within reason.
Carlos and Allison present the idea to the kids, telling them that if they don't get into trouble, do their chores and keep their grades up, they can have a yes day as a reward. Katie makes a wager with Allison that if her mom makes it through Yes Day, Katie will go to the music festival Fleekfest with her mother. If she doesn't make it, Katie will be allowed to go with a friend, Layla. The kids eventually manage to earn a yes day and put together a list of five activities for the day. First, Ellie dresses her parents in crazy outfits. Next, they go and order a massive $40 sundae that is free if they can eat it all in 30 minutes. They then go through a car wash with the windows down. Next, they go to a capture the flag competition, where each family member leads a group and the goal is for one team to catch the others, throwing balloons filled with Kool-Aid at their opponents. Allison wins the game for her team, impressing her kids. Carlos, however, is tempted to drop out of Yes Day, but ultimately decides he can't bear to disappoint his kids.
The fourth event is a trip to Six Flags Magic Mountain, where the family ride roller coasters. When Katie steps away, Allison sees texts on her daughter's phone from Layla indicating she and Katie will be hanging out with older boys at Fleekfest. Allison tells her that the wager is off and she's going to Fleekfest with her, not Layla. Hurt, Katie storms off. In an attempt to win a pink gorilla for Katie as an apology, Allison and Carlos get into a fight with another park-goer and are arrested. The children sneak away. Katie goes to Fleekfest with Layla, but quickly becomes uncomfortable being alone with older boys, and her friend abandons her. Nando stages a ""nerd party"" at the house as the final big event, but it quickly gets out of control when Ellie accidentally sets off a foam explosion inside the house that was meant for the back yard. Meanwhile, Katie's phone dies while trying to contact her siblings and she panics. With help from H.E.R., who is performing at the event, Allison finds Katie and they reconcile. H.E.R. is moved and invites them onstage for a song. Carlos arrives home and finally manages to be a disciplinarian, forcing the party to stop and the kids to help with the cleanup. As Yes Day draws to a close, Ellie makes one final request. They all spend the night playing games as a family in a tent in the back yard, until Nando’s foam bomb (having been flushed down the toilet) starts to fill up the house.
In a mid-credits scene, the Torres family and other players pelt Mr. Deacon with Kool Aid balloons at the Capture the Flag field, as revenge for suggesting Yes Day in the first place.

","Yes Day movie review: Netflix family comedy stays within the lines

There’s nothing subversive, edgy or original about Netflix’s new movie. It knows what it is and makes no apologies for it.

The MCU continues in series form with The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, DC releases an epic new vision of the Justice League and Eddie Murphy returns to a classic.

You have to really respect Yes Day for knowing exactly what kind of movie it is.

It set out to be a wholesome family comedy laden with life lessons, sentiment and charismatic stars. It’s not trying to break the mould or be subversive or edgy. So what you think it’s going to be is exactly what you’re going to get.

When it hews so closely to a tried-and-true template that serves a particular audience, you can’t fault it for not having bigger ambitions. Especially when it ticks all the boxes and doesn’t really stuff anything up.

The only “added bonus” Yes Day is bringing to the table is that it is centred on a mixed-race family, with cultural traditions and a second language seamlessly woven in without comment.

The only “added bonus” Yes Day is bringing to the table is that it is centred on a mixed-race family, with cultural traditions and a second language seamlessly woven in without comment.

Yes Day coasts on the considerable star power of its leads Jennifer Garner and Edgar Ramirez, who plays Allison and Carlos Torres.Allison was a fun person, jumping out of planes, hanging off the side of mountains, following a group of nuns in a foreign city – she was the funnest person she knew. When she and Carlos first met, their life philosophy was to go for it, say yes to everything because you don’t know where it leads you.

Fast forward to the chaos of three kids later and the presiding word out of Allison’s mouth is “no”, frequently phrased as “no, no, no, never, not on your life, don’t even think about it”.

So, when she realises her kids compare her to Joseph Stalin and Benito Mussolini and hurt at being called a “fun killer”, Allison acquiesces to a “yes day”.

For 24 hours, no matter the request, Allison and Carlos have to say yes to anything their kids want. There are limits, of course, including budget, location and legality.

The premise gives Yes Day the opportunity to stage grand set pieces that will really ring the wish fulfilment bells of younger audience members, including gorging on ice cream for breakfast, the greatest all-in water balloon fight and an unusual trip to the car wash.

There’s also a sequence that doubles as an extended ad for US theme park chain Six Flags – but rare is the American family comedy that doesn’t feature a shameless plug.The emotional beats are grounded in the tensions between Allison and 14-year-old daughter Katie (Jenna Ortega), a frequently rehashed dynamic of the teenager who wants independence and the protective mother not yet ready to let her go.

And the onscreen charm of Garner and Ramirez are hard to deny, plus small roles from comedic actors including Nat Faxon, Arturo Castro, Fortune Feimster and June Diane Raphael add a zing.

There are few surprises, if any, in Yes Day, but that familiarity can be comforting for exhausted parents trying to find something the whole family can watch together without any awkward and tiresome questions from curious minds.

Carl, a bank loan officer, has become withdrawn since his divorce from his former wife Stephanie. He has an increasingly negative outlook on his life and routinely ignores his friends Peter and Rooney. An old colleague, Nick, suggests that he goes to a motivational ""Yes!"" seminar with him, which encourages its attendants to seize the opportunity to say ""Yes!"". Carl attends and meets inspirational guru Terrence. Terrence publicly forces a reluctant Carl to promise to answer ""Yes!"" to every opportunity, request, or invitation that presents itself.
Later, Carl says yes to a homeless man's request and is stranded in Elysian Park. Disillusioned, he hikes to a gas station where he meets Allison, an unorthodox young woman. She gives him a ride back to his car on her scooter and kisses him before leaving. After this positive experience, Carl feels more optimistic about saying yes. However, he refuses oral sex from his elderly neighbor Tillie, and then falls down the stairs and is nearly attacked by a dog. Seeing the repercussions of saying no, he goes back to Tillie and to his surprise enjoys the moment.
Carl starts to seize every opportunity that comes his way. He renews his friendships with Peter and Rooney; builds a bond with his nerdy boss, Norman; assists Peter's fiancée, Lucy, with her bridal shower; attends Korean language classes; and much more. He earns a corporate promotion at work and, making use of his guitar lessons, plays Third Eye Blind's song ""Jumper"" to persuade a man not to commit suicide. Accepting a band flyer outside of a coffee shop, he sees an idiosyncratic band called Munchausen by Proxy; the lead singer is Allison. He is charmed by her quirkiness; she is charmed by his spontaneity and the two begin dating.
Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. Having decided to take the first plane out of town, regardless of its destination, they end up in Lincoln, Nebraska, where they bond more. Allison confesses her love for Carl and asks him to move in with her and he hesitantly agrees. While checking in for the return flight, Carl and Allison are detained by FBI agents who have profiled him as a potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Peter, his attorney, travels to Nebraska to explain Carl's odd habits, lessons, and decisions. As she finds out about Carl's motivational covenant, Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere. Deciding that she can no longer trust him, Allison leaves Carl and refuses to return his phone calls.
Carl's life takes a turn for the worse and he almost forgets about Lucy's shower. He manages to arrange a major surprise shower, set his friend Norm up with Soo-Mi, a Korean girl, and Rooney with Tillie. After the party, Carl receives a tearful phone call from Stephanie, whose new boyfriend has walked out on her. When Carl goes to Stephanie's apartment to comfort her, she kisses him and asks him to spend the night with her. After Carl emphatically says no, his luck takes a turn for the worse and he decides to end his commitment to the covenant.
Carl goes to the convention center and hides in the backseat of Terrence's convertible so that he can beg to be released from the covenant. Carl emerges as Terrence drives off, and an oncoming vehicle collides with Terrence, resulting in the two being taken to a hospital. After Carl recovers consciousness, Terrence tells Carl that the covenant was not real, but it was merely a starting point to open Carl's mind to other possibilities, not to permanently take away his ability to say no if he needed to. Freed from this restraint, Carl finds Allison teaching a sports-photography lesson and admits that he is not ready to move in with her just yet, but that he genuinely loves her, and they reconcile with a kiss as Allison's students take pictures.

Yes Man is based on a memoir of the same name by humourist Danny Wallace. The book tells of the 6-month period in which he committed himself to saying 'Yes' to everything based on a brief conversation with a stranger he met on the bus. Wallace also has a cameo in the film, in the final bar-scene of the movie, in which he is speaking to someone behind Danny Masterson.Jim Carrey declined an upfront salary for his role in the film. He was instead paid 36.2% of the film's gross after its production and marketing costs were recovered.During shooting of a scene where Carrey's character bungee jumps off a bridge, Carrey interrupted and asked to do the stunt himself. Carrey stated to the stunt double that he intended to do it in one take. When he jumps off, he is seen taking out a cell phone for the scene.
While shooting the scene in the bar where Carrey's character turns around into a waitress and falls flat on his back, Carrey executed the stunt incorrectly and fell to the floor harder than he expected, breaking three ribs in the process.Carrey learned basic Korean for a scene. Language coach John Song was hired to teach Carrey for ten weeks. Similarly extensive training was needed for the scenes in which Carrey's character learns to play the guitar; Carrey tried to play during the years of his childhood, but ""quit before ever learning a chord"". Carrey said in an interview with HBO: ""Just learning the basic chords was maybe the most challenging part of any movie I've worked on in my career. Peyton [Reed] even joked about the guitar part being dubbed, or just cut altogether."" Reed played the song ""Jumper"" by Third Eye Blind, which had a high number of digital downloads after the film's theatrical release. After the final date of filming, Carrey ""retired"" his set guitar, and Deschanel kept it. When asked about this, Carrey said: ""I'll never need that, or any guitar ever again; guitar is not for me! Never has been, never will be!"" The film's soundtrack features original music by Munchausen by Proxy, a fictional band named after the Münchausen syndrome by proxy (a psychological disorder). In the film, the band consists of actress Deschanel on lead vocals and the San Francisco-based all-female band Von Iva, a trio of vocals, keyboards and drums. Von Iva's members collaborated with Deschanel, a singer-songwriter and one half of the duo She & Him, on writing and recording the band's songs for the film. Von Iva got the part of the fictional ensemble in the film after the movie's music supervisor, Jonathan Karp, saw the cover of their CD in Amoeba in Hollywood. For the DVD/Blu-ray release of the film, Deschanel and Von Iva filmed a spoof MTV music show-style documentary on the band for which they filmed mock music videos for several of the songs; the home video release also includes full-length performances by the group that were not included in the film.
The soundtrack also features nine songs by Eels, including a brand-new song entitled ""Man Up"".The introduction music at the beginning of the film from Carrey's ringtone comes from the song ""Separate Ways"" by Journey. It is also featured when Carrey's character bails out from the hospital to catch the joggography at 6 am.

","Imagine you said ‘yes’ to life’s every opportunity â from giving your wallet to a homeless guy to performing sexual acts with your toothless, geriatric neighbour. That’s the irresistible idea behind Jim Carrey’s latest high-concept comedy, based on the book by Britain’s Danny Wallace (aka that bloke off the telly who looks a bit like Dom Joly).
Here it’s little more than an enjoyable enough excuse to put the increasingly droopyjowled Carrey through the expected variety of rubberfaced situations. Should you see it? Yeahbutnobutmaybe.

The film received mixed reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 6 critics, with an average rating of 4.10/10. On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating ""generally positive reviews"". Chris Azzopardi of The New York Times gave plaudits to Grande's ""charming, relatable"" persona, and stated that the film captures the singer in ""a variety of other off-the-cuff moments that give you the impression that this Grammy winner could be your bestie"".NME writer Hannah Mylrea gave the film 4 stars out of 5, commenting that Excuse Me, I Love You may not be the most revelatory music film, but ""it doesn't need to be"", since it is ""90 minutes of euphoric pure pop"". Johnny Loftus of Decider complimented Grande's charisma, professionalism, and the film's camera work. Dubbing the film ""a gift to pop stans"", Mashable's Rachel Thompson praised the film for how it reminds of the ""simpler times"" prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and admired its setlist. However, she underscored the absence of rehearsal videos like those in Beyoncé's Homecoming (2019) or Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), or like the songwriting footage found in Swift's Miss Americana (2020) and Lady Gaga's Five Foot Two (2017).Rating the film a C-grade, IndieWire critic David Ehlrich compared Excuse Me, I Love You to a ""commercial for a well-manufactured human product"", and described it as ""a lame attempt to peek behind the curtain"". He thought that the film fails to achieve its full potential, unlike the intimacy of Miss Americana. Scoring the film 2 out of 5 stars, Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media pointed out that Grande has ""seemingly effortless vocal talent"", but the concert is ""so meticulously choreographed and staged that they feel almost as much about the mise-en-scène as the music"". Green downplayed the film's editing, and highlighted the presence of superficial chats instead of insight into Grande's life and personality.
